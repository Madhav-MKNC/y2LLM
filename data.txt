the first presentation will be hold by a
Yahtzee from animal car brands so our
animal car brands is publicly listed the
game company rated as one of the top 50
game companies in the world that is
heavily investing in blocking games and
NF T's with brand license from Formula
One Thomas and Friends tour among
astroboy and more and yes you is
chairman and co-founder of animal car
brands and has been an entrepreneur for
over three decades in gaming his first
job was at Atari and he he was named a
global leader of tomorrow and young
global leader by the World Economic
Forum and is a member of the Advisory
Board of BAFTA and a British Academy of
Film and Television Arts
please welcome yes you alright thank you
it's a great honor and pleasure to be
here so I'm gonna talk to you about the
awesome power of NF TS and how it's
gonna save the games industry all right
so as mentioned my name is yatsu I'm the
chairman and co-founder of a local
brands this will be super fast you don't
have to know the details of this but
essentially we are a traditional word
traditional MOBAs game company that
decided to go all-in on blockchain last
year we did 17 different blockchain
investments and one of them later on
will present itself here which is the
sandbox which were very proud of some of
the projects are you know we made an
investment in lucid site which is
basically you know the MOV crypto
baseball and also sort of the crypto
space commander project we also recently
did an acquisition where we bought
basically striking which is fantasy
sports with non fungible tokens and sort
of fantasy sports on the blockchain and
most recently we also announced actually
we did an auction fortress now but we
launched a deal with Formula One or we
have the exclusive rights to do a
blockchain game based on a Formula One
and of course sandbox but I'll let Seb
discuss sandbox afterwards all right
enough advertising all right
so now let me talk about sort of our
industry and why do we as a traditional
games company feel that it is really
important to be looking at blockchain
as you can see this is one of the
forecasts depends when you talk to our
industry you will become 130 some people
say 150 billion dollar industry and that
looks pretty good right obviously it
looks like the numbers are growing up
but in the traditional games business we
have one problem it's the fact that it's
6.2 percent which is really bad news
right it means that we are in an
industry in a traditional game space
that is mature and I think you can see
this today already whether you look at
the growth of most game companies
broadly around the world it is growing
but it is growing slowly right when the
emergence of the rapid pace of growth
came it came from a new source and that
was mobile at the time but now everyone
has a mobile phone so the growth is
essentially stuck and one of the reasons
why this growth is stuck is not because
it says less 2 billion gamers out there
so it's not an issue of audience is
because conversion from freemium which
is the business model that overtook the
industry originally was paid games and
it became freemium games is around 1.5
percent in some cases - and if it's
really good 3 percent conversion and you
can see that when you analyze the
financial reports of all of the major
listed companies that do basic in mobile
games they talk about you know there are
P Dow and their conversion rates so why
is it that when someone plays a game 99
or 98 percent actually don't spend any
money most people actually play for free
and only a small number convert so there
are many reasons but one of the reasons
I want to surmise particularly in the
games that have economies is the fact
that an example here's lineage which of
course everyone in Korea knows really
well is a legendary game one of the very
first super successful MMOs and since
1998 seven or eight years ago had
already raked in close to 2 billion
dollars which back then was a very large
number in gaming because the audience
wasn't that big but despite all of its
success in the same year
they shut down their US server now how
does a product that make two billion
dollars globally but then they shut it
down in the US now that's one example so
when you think that example in the same
time ncsoft
I'm not I'm not by the way I'm not
picking on NCsoft just shut down City of
Heroes as well shortly after and you can
see people were protesting you know
there was a big change that or campaign
that says save our City of Heroes for
those of you who remember it went viral
on Facebook and on Twitter because they
were really trying to stop it and City
of Heroes was maybe not billions of
dollars but was still a tens of millions
of dollars revenue project so what
happens when you shut that down so one
of the challenges is in the gaming
industry today we actually only play for
fun and entertainment we don't own
anything right so it's a bit like when
you go to a clothes store and you buy
some clothes and if the clothes company
shuts down your clothes disappear that's
exactly what happens in the game world
you don't get billions of dollars of
revenue for people spending $1 people
have spent as you may know especially in
Korea tens of thousands of dollars on
their games what happens to the
psychology of a player when you spend
tens of thousands of dollars and then
it's all gone even though you play for
entertainment and you realize that it's
not supposed to be an investment you
still lost money so for those of you who
have maybe made an investment anywhere
around the world after you lose money
are you that interested in investing
again you'll be more careful but what
happens if that can be changed and what
happens if actually when I play a game I
don't actually really end up losing
anything even if the game itself goes
but could we change the way in which we
look at our buying and spending behavior
so right now games is a is something
where we have lost our trust nobody
expects a game to last forever so if it
doesn't last forever
why should I invest in it in a serious
amount why should i convert more this is
where we think non functional tokens in
the
space will save the day so first how do
we get into this space well I think
who here has not heard of Krypto kitties
ok great so I don't have to go to too
much detail since we are after all in a
blockchain event so but broadly speaking
right what crypto kitties did is
introduced the concept of essentially
true digital scarcity and the fact that
people were prepared to spend thousands
of dollars on a digital item that at
that time didn't actually have much
utility other than breeding cats but
that had very unique and scarce features
around them but what became interesting
is that people started spending
thousands of dollars and also started
making money on them as they were
breeding selling and trading these cats
right and it brought the etherium
Network on its knees right that's the
background here and of course that was
made possible because of non fungible
tokens this concept which is essentially
using the same technology with
blockchain that allows fungibility and
trade of a Bitcoin verifying the
scarcity in the uniqueness of every item
but at scale and it means that no matter
you issue a million or one or five items
you can now certify them as unique as
opposed to something that is the same
and you can do that at scale that's
generally mostly what you need to
understand it's important to note that
and if T's themselves are not
cryptocurrencies but they could become
an asset in the past when you look at
scarcity you can have an art item
something like a Picasso but in order
for you to prove that this Picasso has
value you need a certificate you need to
go somewhere to show that yes this
Picasso is worth 1 million or two
million or three million dollars but now
with lock chain this happens
automatically
right and with that you can also embed
permanent value into these items it
doesn't just have to be a skin or look
right or separately when you look at the
crypto kitties you had people pay over a
hundred thousand dollars at the time for
these spare sort of rare digital cats in
the collectible space but the
collectible space in itself is not crazy
to think that people spend that
money even for those of you who collect
stamps or for those of you who collect
baseball cards they go up to the
millions of dollars themselves so now
you can do that
on the blockchain with digital scarcity
that when done fungible tokens and most
recently just last week we sold our own
Formula One car at auction for over a
hundred thousand US dollars in what was
arguably in some cases considered
controversial we won't have to go into
the details however the point being that
someone actually spent a lot of money on
those virtual items and perhaps the most
important thing to note is that outside
of the features and the items of it one
thing is certain this is the very first
and can only be the very first Formula
One car on the blockchain because at
minimum the time stamp ensures that it
can it is the very first one that can
never be another first one right and
that scarcity in itself has value
whether it's worth ten thousand dollars
one hundred thousand dollars
that depends pretty much in the eye of
the beholder now digital items in
collecting for gamers themselves is not
something that is entirely new right so
obviously in the crypto world people
spend a lot of money on these cards
whether it's a garden chain card or
crypto kiddy cards but here is an
example of an item that was basically a
skin for Counter Strike right and the
dragonlore skin was sold for 61 thousand
US dollars it's not even a non fungible
token but it can be used inside the game
and you can show off the skin that you
have while you basically kill your
enemies now what made it special is
because it was signed and autographed by
a famous eSports champion which is
basically skadoodle and this is
important to note because even when you
look at items they may have exactly the
same utility like a cup that I drink
from has exactly the same utility as any
other Cup but if I sell it to you might
be only worth five or ten dollars but if
Michael Jackson owned that Cup is it
worth more it probably is worth more buy
a lot right even though the cup and the
utility is exactly this
so when you start thinking about things
like eSports suddenly the items that
have won a victory or the items that
have gotten you to level 50 or beat a
boss or whatever that may be
that provenance is embedded every time
the item is used so an item has value as
a result not just because of its
function but also its provenance its
history its past it's the reason we pay
for artwork we buy their stories we
don't just buy their function so that's
one problem with solving we think with
blockchain the second one is one around
discovery and something that plagues
game developers around the world for
those of you who are game developers you
might know the story but back in 96
Bill Gates appendices essay basically
saying content is king and he penned
that essay because back in 96 the
internet was just emerging it was just
in the early days and he realized that
because of the internet we would all
have incredible access to free and
steady information and that meant in a
in a world where access was freely
available the only thing that could win
was supposed to be content and everyone
could be a creator that was the promise
and it would be exciting but the problem
is that even though content itself
became abundant actually it was worth
nothing without distribution so jonathan
parolin who was basically a distribution
guy came up with a counter quote and
said yes content is king but
distribution is Queen and she wears the
pants in other words without the Queen
you're dead which probably in some of
our relationships were the wives might
be true too but anyway so point is that
if you don't actually have any way in
which your content can be found then is
your content still worth something and
today when you take a look at this
can there be a Mario without Nintendo
can there be a game of Thrones without
HBO right who owns it what's more
important and unfortunately today
especially when you look at content
outside of games like music the
distributor
owns everything which is why the value
of content has become lower but that's
something that we think blockchain can
fix however for now most of us are using
copies but music is copied digital items
is copied there is no value in the items
themselves so therefore you go to a
place to experience your content where
we think blockchain will change
everything is to do basically an add
value of course blocked in generally as
a concept adds value to everything right
it's the internet of value but more
importantly it will add value to the
content space broadly and especially
with games because now if imagine all
those people who used to play lineage
and lineage shut down all those items if
they were non fungible tokens if they
were on the blockchain you still own the
items so you might ask well I have these
items from lineage that's great but why
would I do anything with them if the
game is dead the difference is because
they're non fungible tokens someone else
can make a game to take advantage of it
so I'll give you an example I like this
example because I play tennis but I
don't know how many of you play tennis
here but let's say all of you bought a
tennis racket for some reason because
some famous k-pop star said I love
tennis and you'll buy a tennis racket ok
and you would have five million tennis
racquets new 5 million owners of tennis
racquets but there are no tennis courts
how many people would open a tennis
court probably a lot because they see a
business opportunity because all these
people have tennis rackets so I'm gonna
open some tennis courts is that ten is
it hundred is a thousand
supply-and-demand
I don't know but that's exactly what's
gonna happen here all the people who
lost their game whether it's City of
Heroes or whether it's lineage or
whether there's world of warcraft in the
future or whether there's Altima online
all of those are communities that have
items or could have had items of value
whether it's a fan driven community or
someone else they will build content for
them and those items will grow in value
and so what happens is of course is that
not only do these items become
interoperable and permanent the buyer
also has
trust because he knows that even though
the game might not be forever the item
is forever and that's important the
example I gave you before was when the
game was dead you lost everything why
would I ever pay a lot of money for
another game but now I have it forever
and we think this is going to change the
buying behavior so that means we think a
future where content is valuable is
going to be such that the content is the
platform that means that in the future
companies will make games based on what
you own not necessarily where you go
today you go to a place to find your
entertainment you go to the App Store
you go to Google Play right or you go to
HBO but if I know that you have lineage
items then I can target you with a world
meant for you right and that's how
communities build value and instead of
the game itself being the ecosystem of
value it should be the items because the
items themselves become more valuable as
more games make use of them and by
themselves the difference here of course
is that in the real world a physical
item loses value maybe because it
depreciates because it just gets used
but in a digital world that can't happen
so it's permanent right so that's kind
of where we think the future will go and
in a way we've seen this before right
minecraft is such an example except it's
not on the blockchain which means the
items aren't transferable but you've
seen a world in which is quasi
decentralized where people can set up
their own servers set up their own mods
and it's kind of owned by a community
instead now to conclude how do I think
this is going to save the games industry
for growth seventy billion dollars last
year was generated in freemium mobile
games so whether it's clash Royale
whether it's you know you know
you know sort of sort of any other
freemium game that 70 billion dollars
came from a conversion that is less than
three or two or one percent because as I
said earlier very few people spend
actually freemium money which means that
if there is simply a one percent
additional conversion that's twenty five
billion dollars of increased market
we're not talking about converting ten
percent we're talking about converting
one percent that's twenty five billion
dollars globally now I imagine if you
knew if you knew that the items you're
spending could maybe have value that
there was scarcity in the model that I
could sell and trade these items at
least I don't lose my money maybe or at
least I can pass them on will I more
likely spend will I have more certainty
to know that these items are not lost
right that's that's what this is about
and we think that true ownership is
going to increase the conversion rate
not by one percent or two percent but by
ten or twenty percent as it should
because now the trust will be there the
blockchain gives it the trust that the
items are permanent through the non
fungible tokens which means that this
could become the growth of an industry
that will not grow six or eight percent
as forecasted but we could grow ten
times to maybe a trillion dollar
industry because now we would trade and
own virtual items in the way that we do
physical items thank you very much
[Applause]
[Music]
okay hi my name is Alex Shin hey what's
up sup Choi
my name is Alex shin one of the partners
had hashed I thought I thought this was
gonna be like a like a meet up at our
office no one told me we got a stage and
hundreds of people and all that good
stuff I also found out that I'm emceeing
this like two hours ago so I'm gonna be
reading off my phone it's not to be rude
just you know I drink too much last
night hashed if you guys don't know we
started out as a group of founders super
passionate about blockchain we used to
call ourselves blockchain
Partners Korea right this is like a year
and a half almost two years ago now from
there some of the founders kind of
rotated out they found that icon they
found that Mehdi block six of us didn't
get didn't have jobs so we got together
when full-time and created hashed and
now you know we had this super big Korea
block Shin week that I'm going to say
was quite successful right
normally hash Knight was a big party
brand but these days were going more
towards education and community building
we are presenting and lightly not too
much cuz you guys just did two days of
conferences a handful of projects that
we are either incubating or lead
investors in to give you guys a sense of
sort of what we're thinking about this
space today
okay uh let's start so first of all
thank you for responding to our interview
request
so I prepared two types of questions the
first category is general questions and
the second category is technical
questions so let's start with the first
questions sure let's do it got it so can
you please tell us about yourself and
what do you do in your team okay
so my name is Jay Kwan I'm a programmer
originally and I've been programming for
about 12 years and you know general
Silicon Valley industry I started off
working for Amazon creating web services
and then one point created a very
popular iPhone app for finding
restaurants and businesses called Yelp
and then Godin got the startup bug and
decided I wanted to create something
interesting so I spent many years trying
to figure out what kind of industry I
wanted to work in and found that the the
blockchain space was the most
interesting for the potential that it
offered so I created this project called
tender mint which is originally created
to replace proof of work as the
consensus algorithm for block chains and
it turned into a company and we decided
to launch a or create the block software
for public blockchain called cosmos
intended to solve the scalability
problem and the proof of stake problem
and various other heart problems so now
I do programming and various other
things for for the tenorman company and
the cosmos project thank you so could
you talk a little bit about your
projects and what kind of reissues in
blockchain space are you trying to solve
and would you explain why it is
important of course yeah so I think the
first thing is
let's start with proof of work because
that's how the project started you know
I think one of the major problems is
that it's environmentally unfriendly to
have work of course many people will
argue that proof of work is okay because
it's still more efficient than the
industry that's replacing but when you
try to extrapolate where blockchains
want to go and in all the use cases that
it wants to enable then then it becomes
very expensive not only in terms of ROI
for the miners who are securing the
network but also in terms of the impact
of the environment and so proof of stake
or at least the kind of purpose take
that we're creating can be very secure
arguably more secure it can be or it is
definitely much faster in terms of
getting finality and it also turns out
that it's it's excellent in terms of
providing scalability because the same
signing identity and something like
tender mint proof of stake can enable
signing on many blockchains in parallel
without sacrificing security so it just
happens to solve a lot of problems now
cosmos is it's a network of block chains
and one of the first block chains that
we're launching is called the cosmos hub
it it's not the only hub but the
function of a hub is it's a block chain
that is intended to connect to many
other block chains to enable token
transfers among many of these block
chains so it creates a interoperable and
scalable token economy by making by
allowing thousands of block change to be
connected to each other so the cosmos
hub is solving many things as a first
it's solving its it's proving that
tenement proof of stake works with many
many signers and with a state-of-the-art
consensus algorithm it's enabling
governance to solve many of the problems
that will arise so it's it's it's really
a self amending ledger and it's also
allowing like I said many block chains
to connect to each other to enable token
interoperability so it'll be it's a
vision division is to create a scalable
and interoperable watching economy by
really solving the hardest problems that
are preventing us from doing that today
so personally I'm very interested in
interoperability so in terms of
interoperability could you give us some
examples of applications that may be
implemented on top of Cosmos sure so the
whole idea with with cosmos
interoperability is that every
blockchain can can solve its own problem
it could be any blockchain that it's
solving a problem for so for example the
cosmos hub doesn't care it doesn't care
what logic the connected side chains
have it doesn't care about the exact
state all it knows is who is responsible
for signing and how the the validator
set is mutating and the cosmos hub keeps
track of the total number of tokens that
are in each side chain so to speak and
so it it totally allows every connected
chain to have its own logic and it can
be about gaming about payments it can be
about content or communication all of
these all of the interesting budgeting
problems can be solved in an isolated
zone and connected with all the other
zones via the cosmos hub so let's jump
into some more technical questions ok so
can you explain about cosmos SDK for the
developers what can they do we
the so when I started working on
blockchains in yes
2013 was when I started looking at
Bitcoin seriously but 2014 I started I
decided that okay here's here's how we
can solve the perfe snake problem I
started looking at all the available
software platforms like what can I
modify to turn into a first state bought
chain but I didn't find anything
available at the time so so we decided
or to create a software framework for
blotching creation because because what
we saw at the time was people were
creating new block chains by forking
Bitcoin or forking you know yeah
monolithic software stacks it was
difficult to create a new block chain
and then etherium came about and so
people could create block chain gaps
using implementing solidity but it was
still it's still difficult to create a
complex application of solidity it you
know it's a new language and append it
snot a familiar language it's so so I
think it's you know if you like the
language go it's a great language for
systems programming of this sort it
allows you to create a complex
full-fledged production application
without any limitation you can tweak any
part of the blockchain like not just a
consensus algorithm if you want to
modify tender it but it's really good at
modularity so if you look at the modules
that we've baked into the cosmos SDK
there's uh there's staking governance
feed distribution and what we call
banking module to help with multi assets
and after we launched a hub we'll be
focusing on finalizing the IBC module -
so you can just import that and you'll
be able to connect with me under bought
chains so the SDK is kind of like like
Ruby on Rails was for web 2.0 it's
intended to be
a framework that gets you from zero to
blockchain I like in a minute
for a simple application but also
extends you to to any use case that you
want to develop so it's a good choice
for a framework and and of course the
cosmos hub itself is built on the SDK
mm-hm
so that's that's how we're building it
thank you
so my next question is about also
interoperability so in order to
interlock a certain blockchain should
use tender mint or they have to be
enjoyed by Delphi nobody so how can
cosmos interlock work with you even
without final movie or is it possible
for Thon's
to use different consensus algorithm
rather than are tender mint yeah that's
a really good question so so IPC which
is our inter blockchain communication
protocol it's kind of like tcp/ip the
initial version that we're building is
going to be between tenement block
chains and so the reason why we're doing
this is because tenements provides very
fast finality for a large validator set
or large signing site so we think this
is in the future going to be a very
popular way to create block chains that
communicate with each other but you
don't have to use tender mint as soon
after we launched a cosmos hub and IBC
I'm sure we will see adapters for other
consensus algorithms that have fast
finality that for example like pbft
might be one and there are others being
developed by other groups so as long as
it has a short merkel or short finality
proof like tenorman does then it should
be easy to make it compatible but for
proof-of-work chains or legacy chains
like aetherium oh I don't want to call
it legacy chain it's still at the most
one of the most popular chains out there
but the proof of work might be like a
say in the future name for proof of work
chains there is a way to make it
compatible buy an adapter layer it's one
design we have for a theorem it's called
Peggy and it involves what
signers that are they are running to
full node of ethereum the proof of work
and then they are signing off on the
blocks that they have seen and so by
committing those witness signatures onto
the blockchain you can come to consensus
about well what actually happened on d3
and blockchain
so that's how we get information from
aetherium to say the cosmos hub and then
it's pretty easy to you just have to
design a smart contract on a thorium to
be able to read any kind of packets that
need to be released any coins I need to
be released on the smart contract side
so it's it's it's it's an adapter layer
we still call it a form of IBC and it's
a bit more difficult or more a bit more
work than the IBC that we're creating
but it's important so we're going to
focus on it soon afterwards with Bitcoin
the story's a little different it's a
bit more difficult because bitcoin is
not only proved work but it's also etyek
so based so it's it requires a bit more
ingenuity and there are many ways to
solve that problem there are some some
groups that are tackling this problem to
connect to the cosmos network using like
the cops SDK so we'll see about that
I think the first step is getting IBC
and then getting d3 MPEG app is it
possible for cosmos embracing the
private blockchains as well yeah
absolutely
so the cosmos hub can connect to public
chains it can connect to other chains
that are running many chains that are
running on the same validator set but
they can certainly connect to private
and consortium chains too so there's no
limit to it's a permissionless system
any any blockchain or their private
consortium republican connect the next
question is cosmas looks somehow similar
to polka dot so could you tell us more
about the differences when compared to
polka dot in terms of scalability
interoperability security and so on
sure so in terms of scalability I think
one of the major differences is that
we're focused on creating a generic like
like a an agnostic protocol that works
with many sovereign chains right so not
only would it work with other block
chains that are run by the same
validator set as the Kosmos hub but you
know it could work with validator sets
in an any you know that are completely
independent so you might have a block
chain that's running in Korea that's
centered in Korea or a block chain
that's being run by you know any other
country or any other set or even polka
dot itself so what we're really trying
to do is create an internet of block
chains like you know we're not just
trying to create a large system with the
same security umbrella that we dictate
we want to help connect many chains that
are that have their own governance
systems in their own and the reasons for
existing so in terms of interoperability
the polka dot is focused on it's it's
trying to if I were to try to describe
what polka dot is doing it's a very
interesting project it's trying to
create a it's almost like a large world
computer right and so the the real a
chain of polka dot is responsible for
relaying messages from one shard I think
they call it a pair of chain to another
pair of chain but I think that's it's a
different kind of problem than the one
that we want to tackle with the cosmos
hub we want to focus on tokens initially
so even though IBC can be used for a lot
more than just token transfers because
like tcp/ip is a generic communication
protocol we think that the token economy
is the primary use case so we want to
address that so so the cosmos hub
unlike the relay chain it
it's it's responsible for keeping track
of the number of tokens on each
connected chain in a sauce roll it has a
governance system so that in case of any
kind of failure the cosmos hub
stakeholders can vote on how to recover
the system so those are some of the
major differences and delays
so one here's maybe something that kind
of illustrates one major difference
tonight if you've heard of like secure
enclaves or or Intel's and sought to
project and so on like block chains that
are running on you know different kinds
of hardware systems like that can also
interpret with the Kosmos hub whereas
polka dot is trying to focus on creating
out putting all the responsibility of
consensus on to the relay chain so it's
a technical difference but uh it's
probably a pretty major and maybe
difficult understand at first but we
have different priorities in terms of
and design philosophies yeah thank you
for explaining and next question is how
can cosmos hop guarantee the security or
data integrity of the Sun so what
happens if there is a double spending in
the specifics on on a specific zone yeah
so oh okay
I think you know there are many many
cases where zones can fail I mean
there's like there's a double spending
which would imply at least some
attendant blockchain that the more than
one-third have tried to double spend me
but there are other cases too like maybe
the chain halted or maybe yeah I mean it
could halt they could it might even do
something wrong because it was software
bug right so in these cases like all
these edge cases that can arise I think
it's respond it's important that there's
a human element that helps resolve the
situation
so the cosmos hub stakeholders are
they're not like regular token holders
like ether holders they're meant to be
you can think of them as they're working
all the time it's their job to maintain
the system and provide an excellent
service to the whole community and
that's why people would adopt the cosmos
hub and so through the govern system
we'll be able to recover in certain
scenarios and then it's it's an ongoing
research topic as to how to address
certain failure cases automatically so
there are many ways that we can
introduce automation into recovery one
example might be if a zone fails we can
if there's for example like a network
halt because two groups have different
ideas about how to move forward it's
possible to to have a vote from the
stakeholders of that chain over time to
see which side has more votes and then
automatically decide to go one way but
not every chain is going to want to do
that some chains might prefer to have
some kind of jurisdiction or people that
decide what to do so we'll be
researching and implementing many of
these solutions for two cosmos of going
forward so cosmos token name is atom
right so and recently a cosmos announced
that the other tokens which is called
photon will be introduced in the cosmos
system so could you tell us more about
the foreign foreign tokens and what is
the difference between a Dementor mm-hmm
so the token is called atom that's the
staking token so like I said earlier
it's it's not like a token that most
people are gonna want to hold it's kind
of like the coin in mining equipment or
Asics
like not everyone should have Asics even
if though they want to use the Bitcoin
blockchain so it's it can be used for
pain transaction fees and you know
paying people but that's not its intent
and if you if you just hold atom tokens
it may not be the best for you because
it's designed to be inflationary because
if you don't stake it and use it then
you'll lose out to inflation now the
photon token is a proposal so you know
after we launched a cosmos Hub we no
longer have the ability to dictate what
happens to the cosmos hub through
governance the cosmos hub will probably
prove of at least one fee token that is
intended to be used by you know non
stakeholders or people who just wanted
token for payments and so we proposed or
we will we will propose or someone will
propose a proposal to do something like
hard fork or hard spoon ether into a
proof of stake chain and and and provide
photons to all the ether holders in
proportion kind of like an airdrop and
that's one way to introduce a few token
into the system or maybe another
proposal will password you know maybe
it's a different kind of token some
other name that is just a initially copy
of the atom distribution we don't know
so it'll be exciting to see what governs
decides on to do so what can your
enthusiastic followers expect us the
next big move from your side to push the
platform forward into the growing
industry well we're we're launching a
test net called the game of stakes it's
it's an incentivize to test net that
will really push the boundaries on on
simulating a tax and testing the
software before we actually launch it
live so that'll be a fun game with we
already have a 300 signups but you know
I don't know if everyone will be able to
participate but it'll be a massive test
net and then soon after that after about
three to four weeks of testing we'll
have will have the launch of the Kosmos
hub so the launch of the cosmos hub is
what I'm most looking forward to
thank you for sharing so this is my last
question no do you have anything to
share or say anything to a Korean
community or hash the community sure
yeah I think that the the amount of
engineering and design that goes into
blockchain like protocol design and
architecture is is extremely interesting
if you're interested in creating you
know a new system for human coordination
you know that's ultimately what trying
to do we're not just trying to create
like a new kind of money or a new kind
of financial system although that's a
big part of it ultimately Bachchan's are
about or solving large-scale human
societal problems that we face today and
you know that's that's why I wake up
every morning and do this and we try to
put you know we try to polish the
software so that it's something worthy
of creating please take a look at what
we're what we've created so far and and
we need your help
so please help us thank you very much
for your time thank you thank you
foreign
Caroline Pham welcome to hasht thank you
so much for having me I'm so excited to
have you and it's it's a truly a
privilege to have you here
so um today
um I have a few questions that I would
like to learn more about your role and
what CFT does so I think the first
question that I would like to start with
you is um how did you come about your
role at cftc and what does cftc
um do
sure so first of all I have to give my
disclaimer that the views that I
expressed today are just my own and
don't represent that necessarily of the
cfdc or any other commissioner so my
role is as a commissioner of the cfdc
the cfdc is a bipartisan commission the
commodity Futures Trading commission
there are five members three of which
are from the president's majority party
and two of which are from the minority
party and one of the three Commissioners
in the president's party is designated
as the chairman so we are the heads of
the agency and we have to vote to take
any agency action so I think two of the
most important parts of my job is making
good decisions on whether it's a rule or
a proposal whether it's an enforcement
action or other matters that come to me
for a vote and then the second part of
my job which I think is really critical
is to engage with the public and to
provide a voice for members of the
industry and other people with interest
and concerns particularly public
interest groups and customer protection
groups that they have a voice into what
the cftc does great and I think the
point about being able to protect the
public I think you've exhibited that
quite well during the financial crisis
and I think the resulting product of the
dot-fract ACT could you talk about your
role in the Dodd-Frank Act and how it
came to be and what does it do and how
does it prolong the mission that you
have at the CFT
sure I'll tell you a little bit about
the history of the cftc so the cftc was
first created because of the need to
have a market oversight regulator over
the agricultural commodity to reduce
markets so Futures on wheat corn
soybeans pork bellies all of these
different types of agricultural
Commodities and they wanted to have
someone to make sure that the markets
were were fair and free
so over time the commodity Futures
Trading commission evolved and in ways
increasing its scope its size and its
importance and also the markets that it
oversaw so in 1974 is when Congress
passed the commodity exchange or the
quantity Futures Trading commission act
which created the cftc as it is in its
current form and so in its modern form
the cftc had its first chairman sworn in
in 1975. what the Dodd-Frank Act did was
really dramatically expanded the
jurisdiction of the cftc over the at
that time the 700 trillion notional
swaps market and it's a global market
and so the cfdc had that expansion of
its authorities and so I think what
people don't realize is even though the
cftc has agricultural routes it is a
regulator with global jurisdiction over
the most complex products out there in
the marketplace and over the largest
market participants which includes not
only U.S and non-us Banks but also U.S
and non-us exchanges and clearinghouses
great and I think the CF as you've
rightly pointed out that cftc really has
an expensive role in jurisdiction over a
variety of assets
um and I think this is kind of a really
nice segue into the role that cftc has
been playing um in the digital assets
Market as early as 2015.
um could you talk about how you became
interested in digital assets and what
have what have you done in terms of your
jurisdiction over digital assets
so one story that I think people don't
realize so much is that I actually first
became interested and started looking at
crypto in 2013. at that time I was at
the cfdc as counsel to commissioner
Scott Amalia and the Bitcoin Foundation
came in and was basically trying to
figure out if the cftc regulated Bitcoin
and you know what struck me about that
time is when we looked at it we
essentially thought well Bitcoin is
something that looks like it's worth
something
so like a store of value and it also
seems to be a way of transferring value
like a means of exchange and even though
here we are uh almost uh 10 years later
it's still the same framework that we
really use the same lens that we use to
look at Bitcoin and all of the other
crypto assets that have developed since
then so
these uh principles and this way of
looking at it I think though always
comes back to the fact that no matter
what type of acid it is uh you know when
you look at it from a trading and
markets perspective it has to adhere to
the same core principles and that's you
know what I like to say is pretty Common
Sense approach don't lie don't cheat
don't steal be responsible and so the
cfdc is well experienced in creating a
regulatory framework that you know true
to our mission promotes responsible
Innovation as well as spare competition
and so I think that's why especially
with our flexible principles-based
approach that is more technology neutral
that's why I think we're well suited to
keep up with the new risks and issues
presented by the crypto sector okay and
if you want to bring crypto assets into
kind of the center of the attention from
the cftc's perspective what are some of
the necessary improvements that you are
seeking personally but also on behalf of
the commission both domestically in the
US and internationally
so I think in order to really Foster
what I call responsible digital asset
markets it's very important for us to
engage not only with the public but also
with the experts the experts in the
industry who best understand the markets
and the technology and the potential
opportunities but as well as the
challenges so one of the things that
I've done is I've outlined 10
fundamentals for responsible digital
asset markets which I think will look
very familiar to many responsible actors
that are out there in the markets no
matter what asset class it is whether
it's equities fixed income rates
currencies or digital assets so I think
that's one important place to start the
other thing that I think is important is
to like I said engage with the public
and the experts and so one way that I am
looking to facilitate that is through my
Global markets advisory committee which
I sponsor and which I believe
is best suited to address the issues and
involved with making sure that there's a
Level Playing Field for Global
businesses and Global markets so through
that I'm looking at creating a
subcommittee on digital asset markets
where we can really harness all of the
brain power and the resources that are
out there to come up with good policy
recommendations you know working with
the private sector together with a
public sector and hopefully these policy
recommendations can become rules or can
be used to inform International
standards
I've read about your Global markets
initiative and I think it's a great
initiative and I think part of it is
because the digital assets themselves
are Global by Nature so I think you
really do need an open-minded regulator
who's not only looking at it from a
domestic perspective but also as a
Global Perspective so I really think
it's a great initiative and best of luck
with that initiative so in continuation
I think there have been a lot of
conversations around your recent press
about regulation by enforcement could
you tell us like how that work came to
be and what does that mean for you and
what do you think cftc can do
perhaps better than other agencies sure
so I'm not sure where that phrase
originally
um came from but it's been around for a
very long time and the way I think about
it is you know in the United States and
this is recognized in our administrative
procedure act which is the way through
which administrative agencies like the
cfdc can promulgate new rules and
obligations for the public
so there's two ways to make rules one
way is through what's called a
rulemaking by adjudication rulemaking by
adjudication is essentially enforcement
actions that are brought in a litigation
type context
and those decisions and opinions have
the force of law
so that's um
one could call that regulation by
enforcement the other way that you can
make new rules is through what we call
notice and comment rulemaking which
essentially requires public consultation
so the agency creates a proposed rule
publishes it and takes in comments from
the public anybody in the public can
submit a comment and then after you know
thorough and deliberate consideration
then the agency can promulgate a final
Rule and then that's the rules that have
the force of law so there's two ways to
do it I myself prefer the latter route
because I think it's very important
again the United States as a
representative democracy makes sure that
the people have a voice in what the
government is doing that's that's really
important I think it's because when you
come up with a new regulation I think
there needs to be in a public
consultation especially some input from
industry players academics experts and
then you have a chance to be part of the
rulemaking process and I think
essentially that's what you're proposing
and that's what you're embracing
compared to perhaps another regulator so
thank you for that
um I think the next question that I
would like to ask then is
um in terms of some of the proposed
bills that the Congress is entertaining
at the moment what are some of the
proposed bills that are circulating out
there and what do they say about you
know cftc's role Within
so what I really appreciate about the
various legislative proposals in the
United States so one of which
um is the lemus gillibrand bill which is
a holistic and very comprehensive
approach to regulating digital Assets in
the United States but there's other
proposals including the just announced
Senate agriculture committee Bill the
digital Commodities consumer protection
act sponsored by chairwoman stabenow and
Senator John Bozeman there's a similar
bill that was previously proposed by the
house agriculture committee that's the
digital commodity exchange act but what
all of these bills have in common is
that they recognize the cftc's current
and appropriate role as having oversight
over digital Commodities we have already
said back in 2015 that Bitcoin is a
commodity a virtual currency subject to
the cfdc's jurisdiction and since that
time we have identified other tokens
which we have said we have jurisdiction
over that includes ether but it also
includes Litecoin Dogecoin and you know
other other tokens as well so
I think it's great that these
legislative proposals make it very clear
as to the cfcc's jurisdiction here and
make it very clear the cftc's ability to
require registration and Licensing and
Regulatory requirements that ensure that
the right protections are in place for
both the markets as well as for
customers things like minimum Financial
resource requirements risk management
standards disclosures customer
protections conflict of interest
protections all of these things are very
critical to make sure that we have safe
markets that work for everybody great
and if these bills or one of the bill
the bills if they do pass ncftc gets
this jurisdiction over digital assets
would you think this is advantageous to
the industry or not
well we are a tough regulator so anybody
who thinks that they're getting off easy
with us might have missed the fact that
we just filed an enforcement action for
1.7 billion dollars over a Bitcoin Ponzi
scheme
um which I think also shows our Global
reach because you know some of that did
involve other countries you know outside
the United States so that's one thing I
want people to be really clear and to
understand we've brought over 50
enforcement actions since 2015 with
penalties in the hundreds of millions of
dollars but I think what um is well
suited with the cfdc's approach and
which makes us
built to regulate Innovation is because
right there in our mandate and our
mission it says that we are to promote
responsible Innovation and Fair
competition and I think that with our
principles-based approach that means
that we can anticipate and adapt to new
risks and new issues more quickly we can
harness the power of the industry to
come up with Solutions in order to
address potential issues in our markets
and you know most of all it's a balanced
approach which also has a
a pragmatic
way of looking at dealing with you know
any potential issue that might come up
so you know that is where I think
because
we engage with the industry and we
engage with the public and we make it
their responsibility as well as ours to
police the markets and to make sure that
we have safe markets that work for
everybody I think people appreciate that
that they do have a voice I certainly
agree with that um cftc is a tough
regulator but at the same time I think a
sensible one and especially because you
are encouraging public consultation and
the inclusion of that voice I think you
know I have been arguing for you know
clear regulation from the beginning and
I think there are enough good actors out
there who want to do that but you know
that Clarity hasn't necessarily come
through so I really hope that you are
able to be the beacon of light for the
industry so we bring everything to the
light thank you I always say it's about
first principles and that's clear rules
of the road people can't build and grow
compliant digital asset markets without
knowing what are the rules of the road I
completely agree with that so thank you
um so you are obviously in South Korea
is this your first time visit
um and can you tell us a little bit why
you decide to come to South Korea for
the career blockchain week in 2022 yes
thank you so it is my first time in
Seoul it's very exciting it's not my
first time in Asia Pacific but one of
the things that is always really
impressed me and has been one of the
reasons why I really enjoy the
opportunities to come out to Asia
Pacific is because of the tremendous
energy out here and the growth you know
there's there's so many opportunities
there's so much growth as well as just
an openness I think there is a a mindset
that is a growth mindset that is focused
on
Innovation and Adoption of new
technologies it but it's not one that's
just rushing into something new without
thinking about all the different issues
I just think it's more of a willingness
to embrace new advancements and and that
kind of forward-looking approach is
something that really appeals to me and
it really calls to it speaks to me so
that's one of the reasons why I love
being here and I really like to connect
with and to understand that you know
where you have such a tremendous
technology sector uh one where you do
have sort of mass adoption
um and particularly with some of the
developments in gaming in web3 uh and uh
you know internet of things and and
Beyond that's why it's very exciting for
me to be here in Seoul well we are
certainly honored to have you here
um so I would like to end this interview
with one last question which is um at
hash we try to be a very um you know
standard setting VC that's promoting you
know good actors and you know
responsible Innovation
um so in your opinion what do
responsible VCS and portfolio companies
what do they look like within the
industry so I think this again goes back
to what is a really Common Sense
approach also it is don't lie don't
cheat don't steal and be responsible and
there are um just a wealth of
information out there on best practices
I think for those startups that even
though they're in crypto
they might not just be a tech company
they may actually be a financial
institution or financial services
company so I think it's very important
to really understand the activity that
you're engaged in and to understand if
it does become Financial Services
activity which then is subject to pretty
strict requirements you know given that
you are handling people's money
um but the the basics for being
responsible are very similar across the
board so it's having a very strong risk
management program understand the risks
that you're getting yourself into and
have a way of managing those risks and
mitigating them what controls do you
have in place having a compliance
program having policies and procedures
having protections against conflicts of
interest to make sure that the
incentives are aligned so I think this
comes back to you know having a really
strong management team and one who
really takes ownership of
um of the business and you know has
accountability so
I don't know that it's anything
different from what any of our parents
would have told us
but I think it it helps to just keep
that in mind you know am I doing the
right thing is this the right thing for
you know my clients my customers my
communities
um is it the right thing for the markets
it's the right thing for the ecosystem
and I think if you ask stop and ask
yourself those questions
um then it may not be as hard as people
think I think that's really wise not
only for the industry but also as a
human being who wants to do it
so thank you for your wisdom it's been
about four months into your
commissionership and I know that you
have about four more five more years for
your tenure I wish you the best and
given what you've achieved in the past
four months I cannot wait to see what
you're doing the next course so
congratulations and thank you for
joining us once again thank you so much
it's an honor great
like Natalie and Brittany welcome to
Heist thank you for having us yeah of
course of course so before we get
started I would like to tell our
audience more about you so Brittany and
not only if you can introduce yourselves
it turns out the great of course hi my
name is Brittany Kaiser I am the
co-founder of the own your data
foundation with my sister Natalie
specifically to make sure that we have
the future where people are digitally
literate
so that you actually understand on a
day-to-day basis the data you produce
and how to protect yourself
so I'm Natalie Kaiser I'm the co-founder
of the own your data foundation
advocating and implementing digital
literacy curriculum in schools
corporations and legislative initiatives
to provide a positive digital future for
people to protect themselves and own
their own date
great let's get started so I like to
start with you Brittany I know that you
have an eclectic experiences under your
belt so can you tell me a little bit
about your debut to the blotching
industry and what motivates you to be in
it of course I first learned about
blockchain when Bitcoin first came out
and a lot of my friends in the human
rights industry were using Bitcoin in
order to send tips to each other at the
time when Bitcoin was saw a cents on the
dollar and so you would add that as a
tip if people were to give each other
good advice or were to have done good
work back in the day the reason why I've
come back to the industry I was very
into it up until 2014 then I spent a
couple years at a company called
Cambridge analytic and I saw how much
the data industry has become a
kleptocracy and how people have spent so
much of their time producing value
producing data yet the data has been
stolen from them and they don't know
where that has gone how many companies
and governments around the world have
bought and sold and traded that and what
does that actually mean for their I
would say it means for their privacy but
mean for a lack of their privacy and how
can distributed ledger technology bring
transparency and bring
ways of tracking and traceability and
also being able to share the value of
data with individuals that are producing
it great and I think that's a wonderful
segue to Natalie's question I've noticed
that you're wearing a necklace which
feed on your data could you tell me
about the hash tag on your data movement
yes well she was one of the pioneers of
the anya dayta campaign obviously after
exiting cambridge analytic and realizing
the importance of data rights and
empowering people to own their data so
we recently co-founded the own ear data
foundation to provide educational
resources and the tools to equipped the
general public creating a systemic
change in the educational system you
know hopefully moving into the HR
systems of major corporations and also
to educate legislators and the
governmental changes that they're making
into
the importance of digital literacy and
how it is so pervasive in our society
and how important it is to lead a
responsible educated informed digital
life so there can be a consensual
transparent society moving forward
I'm inspired that vision especially for
me from a legal background I you've been
proposing digital right as a new human
right what are some of the implications
and what does that exactly mean so I
spent about a decade working in human
rights legal advocacy and realizing that
it's very difficult for governments and
also legislative frameworks to protect
human rights but the most protected
legal value in most systems is property
that's usually where most countries have
been founded on so if you own something
like a property you are ascribed all of
these different rights to transparency
and the use of it and to be compensated
for it and then also legal recourse if
someone abuses your property right so if
we're going to talk about data rights
one of the most important ways to look
at it is to actually say hey I produce
data every single day these are the
assets that are probably the most
valuable thing that I produce and
somehow companies are making trillions
of dollars off of my value so why don't
I own my data in the same way that I own
my car or my house so if you think about
the Airbnb model if people want to
license my data instead of a company
like Experian or Facebook licensing that
data I should be able to license that
data myself and just like on Airbnb
I would be told who wants to use it what
they're gonna use it for for how long
and I would get paid before I would
handle it keys right and if somebody
decided to mess up my house or abuse my
data then I would have a legal recourse
for that and that was one of the most
foundational frameworks of some of the
new laws that we've implemented
purchasing exciting so before going into
your legislative initiatives and Natalie
I know that you have some coding
background so could you give us like a
brief description of how blockchain is a
tool can enable that protection of
misuse of your personal data for
instance well blockchain and distributed
ledger technology gives you the ability
to have tracking and traceability and
gives you the recourse to actually be
able to
hold people accountable in a transparent
way for their actions being able to see
what's done how it's used what it's used
for where it's given to for what purpose
lock chain actually gives you the
ability the technical solution to enable
a lot of the legislative frameworks that
they've been working so hard on in
Wyoming because without you can
establish all the legislative frameworks
you want but without the technological
solutions you can't actually enable them
and watching this very positive
progressive way of doing that and
actually gives you the technological way
to do that whereas right now it's
lacking a lot of valid solutions
so I think that's the most perfect way
to I guess go into your next initiative
which is you have the digital asset
trade association what coming down is
data
yeah I've been checking out your media
page and I noticed that you're working
closely with government to come up with
innovative legislations could just talk
to could you talk to us with us some of
the efforts behind of course so the
reason why we originally formed was
because this amazing woman called
Caitlin Lange was working with House
Representative Tyler Lynn home in
Wyoming in order to combat the money
transmitters act in the state of Wyoming
which basically meant that something as
simple as Caitlin was trying to donate
to the University of Wyoming and Bitcoin
to create a fund for female engineers
and she was told that she couldn't yeah
you would as an individual have to
basically have the same license that not
only a bank but anyone else that is and
transmitting money as your own
profession right and so she decided to
start writing an exemption with
representative living home and from
there they realized that they had so
much support for this to actually enable
individuals to make their own
transactions that they started to write
the first definition of a utility token
in law which was pretty exciting and
from there it is not a snowballed into
13 different laws we originally started
data to go and support them in this
effort because in order to pass a law
especially for emerging technology is
that most legislators don't understand
it takes a lot of meetings you have to
explain to legislators what is this new
technology why is it important to the
state why is this going to be positive
for the economy
what are the protections for individuals
that are getting involved in this new
technology that isn't fully developed
yet and what does all of that mean so we
put boots on the ground they flew a lot
of people out to Wyoming sit there and
have meetings with everybody in the
Senate everybody in the house and to do
public testimonies to explain what all
of these things are and why the state of
Wyoming could become the new financial
capital of the US as opposed to states
like New York that have legislation that
makes it very difficult for people to
even build a blockchain company let
alone to normally you know do business
and transact so if you're going to look
at the type of work that has been going
on in Wyoming you can look at it from a
lot of different levels but you can
basically say it's been the first time
where legislators have actually listened
to what entrepreneurs need if you are
trying to build a business what type of
legislative framework do you need to not
only build your company but to make sure
that it is sustainable to make sure that
you can do your business and to attract
consumers and the Wyoming legislative
framework has really thought through all
of that and also thought through
protecting individuals so there's
there's a lot to be said so let's kind
of dissect some of the bills that are
being considered
so can you walk us through one or two
couple specific examples and what are
some of the outcomes that are expected
and what advice would you give to
industry leaders to follow of course so
there's there's some very exciting news
which is that there have been 13 new
laws that are already passed so I can
talk about some of those but also
there's some really new exciting ones
that are coming up during this next
legislative session so my favorite of
all of the laws that have already been
passed signed by the governor there in
law is that your digital assets are
defined as your intangible personal
property so a lot of reasons why our
data is not protected in the same way
that our house or our car happens to be
is because we can't see it people don't
understand it you can't touch it and you
can't see it then the lack of
understanding and the lack of
legislative protection seems to be quite
pervasive so for the first time we look
in law at an intangible personal
property that still ascribes all
property rights to your data or your
digital assets and that means that now
if someone is to have a data breach in
their company you actually have legal
recourse say you now might have to spend
the rest of your life with fraud
protection because now out on the
internet happens to be your social
security number your banking details
that anything else that you could
possibly think of this protects you so
that you actually can do something about
it I was an expert witness in the first
successful case against Equifax and it
was the same principles we basically
said because Equifax was negligent in
its security protocols and its data
protection protocols is that the
property of all of the people in the
data leak was damaged and so that
property damage means
Equifax is not responsible for for
paying for the fraud insurance for
everybody that was in the data leak for
the rest of their lives now the most
exciting new law which is being
considered it is open source coding
beings handsome out to the right to free
speech so a lot of people who are
open-source developers have come up with
legal issues over the past couple years
because someone takes their code and
decides to develop to develop a platform
out of it in that platform then gets
into some sort of situation where you
know people's data is breached or
something some other type of you know
issue occurs and it comes back to the
developer now a developer creating open
source code is essentially not doing
this because they're paid to do it
usually they're doing this because they
believe in what they're building and in
the state of Wyoming the legislators
think we want all of the smartest and
most capable developers in the world to
feel comfortable coming to i/o mning and
you can develop anything you want if
people are going to take your code and
build something off of it then that is
their liability they should go and audit
your code they should decide if it's
something they want to build off of and
then they go ahead but if your code is
going to be exploited that has nothing
to do with you and you should be free to
be able to sit there and build so it's
how incredibly libertarian viewpoint but
really exciting I think for the
developer community and I already know a
lot of companies that are looking to
relocate to Wyoming if that goes through
I think I just want to highlight that
from a regulatory perspective most
people think that because
so new even though I person disagree
that it is new I think a lot of people
think that you need to come up with this
very difficult massive new regulatory
framework but what you're saying is that
if you have couple smart enabling
statutes and pack it up you can actually
reinterpret a lot of the concepts that
already exist fraud property for
instance so what kind of message would
you deliver to regulators around the
world outside of Wyoming to encourage
innovation and also attract
entrepreneurship it's aimost
regulators and legislators are used to
protecting individual citizens or
individual investors but it's meant to
protect an individual as living and
working in that country but if you only
think about what the individuals need
you you are not really thinking about
entrepreneurs as individuals and the
fact that an entrepreneur is trying to
build a company to solve a problem
that's mostly where entrepreneurs
especially in the black chain space are
looking to go and if you give them an
extraordinary amount of hurdles and
loops to jump through then your cycling
innovation so what I really would say to
regulators is one of the most important
things you can do is consider what
businesses have to say consider what
entrepreneurs need in order to build and
then balance that with the need to
protect citizens because it's very
possible to listen to people who want to
innovate and also make sure that
citizens are not abused at the same time
it's totally possible it's been done
they've proven it in Miami and I think
that most other states in the US as well
as countries around the world are now
trying to copycat the legislature
framework there so it proves that that
type of mindset does actually work so if
let's say all this goes through and
start going in then I can somewhat
anticipate Wyoming being at the next
Delaware for LSE so what you might not
know is that actually Wyoming invented
the LLC oh my 1970s
okay so Delaware just I guess had a
better marketing campaign but Wyoming's
come back to get them on this one
because the legislative framework they
have created is now attracting companies
from all over the world we have hundreds
of new companies that have already moved
to Wyoming including multi-billion
dollar companies I mean we've had you
know Cardno and crackin and all of these
huge names in the blockchain industry
even relocate they're not just startups
that are doing their first registration
but actually either read on the styling
in Wyoming for those protections and not
just protections but also opportunities
so that the government of Wyoming now
has sandbox legislation so that you can
have government funding from the
Secretary of State or the banking
commission in order to test out your
ideas you know without worrying about
the local regulations so you can do
pilot testing and there is a new
special-purpose depository institution
license so that you can I mean it's
really the first crypto bank so as of
right now you can't lend off of it yet
but we're moving in the right direction
so it's pretty exciting to see what you
can do if you actually listen to
entrepreneurs while carrying what your
citizens need so given that Wyoming has
such a hospital environment set on what
applies would you give to foreign
companies looking to read almost out of
her house
in Wyoming and be able to utilize a lot
of dispensers being offered well I would
say it's really easy to sign up a
Wyoming LLC you can do it online
watching LLC do you think that get it
done same day or even next day it's very
fast your Wyoming LLC can physically
domicile your digital assets in Wyoming
so your wallet can be domiciled within
the state which gives you rights to all
of those tax laws even if you yourself
as an individual are not there so
Wyoming LLC is beneficial for people in
other countries but also if I'm talking
to regulators in other countries you can
start to think about what might be the
benefits of those laws to make sure that
the companies that would originally be
created in your country are not being
attracted elsewhere but if you are
living in a country that does not have
hospitable laws or does not have enough
legislation in the first place then you
should really think about looking at a
place like Wyoming because a lot of
entrepreneurs around the world it's not
that they've built their company in an
unfriendly framework and then they've
had problems it's that they've built
their company in a framework that
doesn't exist yet and then new laws come
in once their company has already been
built or they've already done their
fundraising strategy and then they have
to deal with problems and regulation
that come in later so that's that's a
huge problem when you think about people
who worked so hard for years and years
of their life and they finally fundraise
and they built a solution and now
they're having all of these problems
just because they didn't have rules to
begin with and now what they have
doesn't abide by whatever rules came
about while they were building it's a
huge problem in this industry because
everything so cutting edge
moving so fast and so new so if you are
starting a company and distributed
ledger technology you don't understand
the regulatory framework in your country
build your company somewhere else that's
a very practical advice so as the ending
discussion Natalie I guess to follow up
with my question earlier what's some of
your outlook for the industry what can
we expect and anticipate hope for I
would love to hear your insight
I think from my point of view pretty
much advocating for digital literacy
you have a stronger awareness moving
forward from the general public and
every actor who's participating in this
have a greater understanding of how it
works about their power to own their
value to own their data that they have
the ability and the solutions to do so
and they have the resources to educate
themselves and really enhance their
families their communities nations at
large a global expansion of this is
really where I see them
right yeah I mean I I would just add to
that by saying the global expansion of
this industry is definitely where it's
going and I I don't think there's any
question of that anymore it's it's you
know the skills have totally tipped
we're no longer begging for mass
adoption
we're just begging for standards higher
standards of people that are in the
industry and making sure that we are
solving problems and all agreeing on
what we're trying to achieve well I
think that's a wonderful note to end
thank you for taking the time to meet
with me um so I would like to end by
doing our signature move on hashed which
is this yeah which is like our grant so
let's just say thank you our audience
thank you
suppose a son in Cumbria took from the O

to protect against me that welcome
mister took blue I thank you I hello
everyone I hope you guys not too hungry
yet yeah so yeah it's a great honor and
pleasure to be here you know speaking to
with hash and which is a you know great
audience so we would like to tell you a
bit about our project camp area which we
trying to do the AI and robotics
platform of the future so you know if
you think about consumer robots right
usually people would imagine something
very Q and used useful can do different
tasks like the picture is shown here but
in fact in reality if you think about
the capabilities of robot especially in
the home the capabilities are still very
limited right we only have toys robot or
something like a vacuum cleaner only
other stuff like the pepper or the Assam
oh they're way too expensive for the
value that they can bring to the end
consumer and so no one really has
cracked the trillion-dollar market of
consumer robot yet the truth is robotics
development actually very high right
it's actually slow expensive I take a
team of many different expertise and it
need you need manufacturing you need
prototyping all of that and the result
is there are very few big company have
the technology for example Softbank
toyota boston dynamic right and the rest
you know they everyone is trying to
reinvent the wheel
not much if technology is being shared
across different project and so we know
because
you know we went through the same
journey and we figure out that 85% of
all the effort by the teams are
reinventing a will so what we want to do
is we want to propose a new kind of
platform kind of like open source like
Android and Linux with has a massive
impact social and globally but you know
the traditional open source they do have
shortcomings right I take a long time
for Android or Linux to gain the
necessary momentum but also they have a
lot of issues like the free rider people
using the technology without
contributing back or the first mover
incentive how do you get the those first
developers to be on the platform so kind
of so this is how we design our platform
with blockchain and crypto economics to
really align on the incentive of people
on the platform to overcome these
challenges so a little bit segue into a
game theory so game theory actually one
of my research back at my PhD at
Stanford so that's something that really
drawn me to this whole space of crypto
and blockchain because it's like we can
design a new game that people can play
that will actually dictate a different
outcome so if you think about the
robotic work if you will you can you
know model is this a recent dilemma game
right so prisoner's dilemma is when
people have two options either cooperate
or defect and you know the Nash
equilibrium is always define right so
that's the best choice it's the same as
in the robotics were the best choice for
companies always to just keep the
technology secretive and you know not
contributing by however because of the
blockchain and crypto economics we can
design a new game now it's a repeated
game in which we can enforce certain
outcome using what we call grim trigger
strategy so that the cooperation is the
way for people to work together and
that's a better outcome for everyone so
with this you know we can come up with a
brutal optimal Nash equilibrium with you
know the cooperation between different
companies in this new game that we
design with Cambria so with that we can
be a I and robotic future in which when
developers want to view new robots they
can really easy use order existing
technology from the platform whether
it's a plant watering robot or food
delivery or robot to for laundry or
picking up a cabbage
instead of had to reinventing the wheel
they can just pick off the existing
technology from the platform and and
build it together so we introducing
Campea camera is the open robotics
platform that we are developing so
Cambria has five different components
and a call came here is something we
call code base K DNA which let me see if
I could make a DNA which is the open
platform that would include all the
hardware firmware software AI everything
that you need to build and run the robot
and then we support it with an alliance
called Cambrian manufacturing Alliance
which allow people to prototype and
produce this robot very quickly and then
on top of that we have an innovation
marketplace it's just like XPrize or the
DARPA challenge right so basically it's
a way for people to come up with
innovation
you know either through putting out
bounties or kind of like go do like a
GoFundMe project and the other two
components that we put on Campea is one
is for fair use and equal protection so
think of it we call as a proof of
violation so basically we allow the
community to rally together to protect
the innovation that developers can come
up with that they put and share on
cambria and then last but not least an
app store where people use the token to
buy to acquire robotics technology or
services so you can read more about how
the different components on a platform
in Thai in the white paper but I'm just
going to walk you through a simple use
case right so companies like McDonald
because they serving user they see a lot
of different opportunities and needs for
robotics application so now because they
wanted let's say they want to be a robot
that can flip burger right so instead of
you our team you know costing millions
of dollars and several years to view out
this robot they can put a bounty on
Campea using our tokens and get a team
of developers working to solve these
challenges all the backers order to
controllers believe in this project they
can chip in as well you know stake that
token behind that project and now they
can have a team of developers around the
world working together to solve you know
the robot the robots that can flip
burger and the best technology will get
incorporated onto the platform the team
would then win the tokens you know for
their technology the technology will be
share and open between other people so
that companies can use it and provide
services to the youth to the end-user
all the values generated from the user
will then get split between other
developers and baked goods through a
platform using smart contract and so
this is a way that so that people can
share the benefit of the technology that
can come out of Cambria so what are the
competitive advantage of came here so
you might be wondering why do we need a
tokens right why do we need our own
tokens so if you think about it
I want tokens a way for us to bootstrap
the community very quickly so that
instead of you know let's say if we pay
developers using Fiat or even you know
aetherium the the developers won't have
the long-term incentive you know to
provide and mint mention and the code on
the platform and moreover we can bring a
lot of technologies onto the platform
using our token so let's say you know
there are a lot of good technology you
get here in the way locked up in
patterns or research labs for example
Stanford right so if we
de Centro we said hey here's $100,000
you know why don't you lisen open your
technology to the world to use but
Stanford it's not gonna talk to us you
know it's too small for them but if that
hundred thousand has potential to grow
into a million ten million one hundred
million dollars right now it's a very
interesting conversation to them so this
way we can bootstrap not only the
community but also the technology
platform and then the network effect of
course right all token holders is
ambassador of the platform and everyone
can bring the technology think of
different use cases and apply and really
unlock different in here and market for
robotics application and then the other
two we you know the we can't address the
existing challenges of open source
project such as a free rider or the
first-mover incentive so what are we
doing here is essentially the
centralizing and democratizing fight
things one is robotic development so
normal no longer you need a full big
clap of you know 20 30 people to work on
a project you can really develop new
technology just in your garage through
our platform because you have everything
there you can download the robot and you
can you know get us prototype for you
you really need to focus on the 5% that
would actually make a difference that
you're most passionate about the second
thing is technology ownership right so
we believe that AI and robotics
technology are way too important to just
belong to a few big company right it
should be owned by the community and so
all the token holders is essentially an
owner of this technology and then also
manufacturing capability so we have a
new way of manufacturing the robots
using 3d printing and so that's for us
that's actually kind of like a factory
in a box so instead of having to set up
big facility in China to make all these
robots with injection molding we can
just a very small facility which I will
show you in the video shortly
allow us to prototype providing all
these manufacturing services and then we
can also enforce collaboration you know
every token holder is now essentially a
whistle blower that you know make sure
that the older people are playing nice
together and last but not least product
monetization right one of the very big
challenge of Robotics in the consumer
space is you need to find that cooler F
and no companies has found that killer
apps yet because you know every your a
different technology have different
application different markets has their
own you know like needs and so with
Cambria we allow any entrepreneur any
stuffs that you guys you know you can
think of a new use case then you can
very quickly instead of have to like
raise ten hundred millions dollars and
develop the robots you can just go to
camp here order exactly exactly what you
need and try to crack open the market so
this way is really you know opened up so
that there's a huge collaboration on
both side from engineering to
commercialization of robotic technology
so the way that we imagine is is we
starting out with telepresence robot and
we're adding more components and
features on top of the robot including
arms that can manipulate objects and
moving things in the world and really
try to tackle many different use
different use cases so we're gonna start
open our first platform which is a
telepresence robot here put it on Campea
and allow people just to have fun with
it and push for different technology so
our progress so far we have built the
best customizable and programmable
telepresence robot in the war we have
more than 200 worldwide so I think we
are the only block chain ico project I
actually have a physical product only in
the market and selling we actually
really already reached generation of
robot with less than a million dollars
men in two years this is unheard of in
this dinner space because of the way
that we can manufacture
the robot very very interestingly so let
me show you a tour of our office and how
we manufacture these robot parts right
here in Silicon Valley in California
this is the back cover of and you can
see this filament coming down and
getting melted and almost like socks are
being squeezed and sort of built up
layer by layer to make the parts with
everything that you'll see all sorts of
small parts this is around up mounting
area for the display and we actually
make this process really optimized and
as efficient as possible so we even
wrote our own where they software here
to control and sort of manage the entire
fleet of printers and for production we
have two cycles a day a day in the night
cycle and we we have these parts that
we've designed these are serve our
Kanban carts and in these carts every
part has a place and we know what the
print name is and whether it's day or
night with so we basically print and
fill up these racks and then we send
them off to assembly which is just you
know 20 feet away so we started there
buying printers and modifying them for
24/7 use but we actually now are moving
to designing and building our own so
these that we build and design ourselves
and build them using 3d printers as well
we do a building is much larger and now
we can have one cycle a day instead of
two and you can fit a lot more parts on
the Panettiere it also allows us to make
things more precise over time and makes
our operation and maintenance a much
easier and over here you'll see
one of our large format printers this is
where we can print huge sections of the
robot in one shot it gives us a lot of
design flexibility it allows us to
eliminate a lot of assembly steps
because we can print such large pieces
in one shot and so where do you need to
be the first company to really bring
this process to massive scale for
robotics and will continue to be
building on all these printers over time
here we are over in our assembly and
inventory area so here you can see a
symbol which we not a parcel and all
assembled on my own house and very low
in battery because we can follow like
the trestle motor for doing drives the
wheels of the robot over here we have
the assembly stations and we try to
optimize all them for being as neat as
possible and the final stage so these
are the fully assembled robots waiting
for a final QA and delivery and come
back next time and we'll share with you
all the cool things we're working on and
what else we're adding to the robot cool
thank J so this so we okay let's see so
we we've been around two years and a
half we were really good press coverages
so you know all the majority of the news
big news outlets in the US and the world
and we also building out a lot of
different partnerships so the idea is
the way that we're gonna be around the
ecosystem by bringing in universities
that are tough in the robotics area and
building out all this robotics lab so
that they can work on cambria building
new technology using Cambria and they
can you know contribute back to the
platform but also we bring in corporate
partners who need all these robotics
applications but you know they can start
using they can put out bounties on
Campea to develop all these technology
so for our team so I myself my
backgrounds I did undergrad at Carnegie
Mellon PhD at Stanford I have started
and so several companies including one
to Google so for Army Lab we we started
in July 2015 and Janet is actually was
my room
back then at carnegie-mellon we did a
lot of research together especially in
the road robotic space and you know got
along very well and so we set out to you
really we want the the biggest vision is
we want to make something useful for
human right you know not just like some
robots in the factory that take away job
but really something in the world that
providing value to people improve the
quality of everyday life and our third
co-founder he is in Vancouver work with
Jared very well you know at magnet at
his previous company we have really
strong leadership to him as well most
notably we have a professor from
Carnegie Mellon
her name is Medal of Valor so she was
the president of triple AI for several
years head of machine learning at
Carnegie Mellon probably one of the top
robot professor there very strong
advisory board as well with a lot of
different you know faces figures from
the critter world but also the business
were so for our tokens we're gonna issue
five billion tokens and we want to raise
with 25 million hard cap and 12 million
soft cap 50 percent of the token is
gonna be distributed in the token sale
but more importantly they're gonna be
20% of token they're gonna be
distributed to build a robotic community
so to us the robotics committee is also
very important fund allocation okay so
let me show you another clip before we
parkways so this is the demo of the arm
we brought the arm here the arm is has
many different uses cases and one of the
use case that we kind of play around
with right now is a water plane so you
know when we go away you know the arm
can they continue to take care of the
planes for us so uh so like an arm like
this high precision high toy is gonna be
like around ten thousand dollars in the
market but because we 3d print the
parks and really build this using
low-cost hardware but writing software
to accommodate all the shortcoming of
the hardware we can be on only this for
less than five dollars this is like a
totally game changer all right so sign
up for our telegram Channel is that the
handler is Cambria Korea so we create
one just for you guys
and you know we're gonna give out these
three printed logo so we have two of
these and so you know if you sign off in
the next half an hour we're gonna pick
two random people from the list and then
give out this logo for you guys so you
know goda came here Korea and I would
like to introduce my co-founder Jared
NGO who give you some short demo it's
not here so this is a robot that so
jared is controlling it and it's
connected to the Internet so basically
you can you know control it from
anywhere in the world as long if you
have internet and you're gonna have to
waste video and audio communication so
you can see the other side you can hear
them you can you know go to the kitchen
you can stay in the living room you know
one of the biggest attraction that we
have so far is from family with aging
parents and grandparents and so you can
put this in the home of your parents or
grandparents and spend time with them
just like you being there so we had a
lot of different packages that we are
deploying on this so for example
navigation using computer vision
we have a robot like this
hello so if we have a robot like this
people already come to us asking hey can
I add a tray can I add the arm can I add
special lights you know I want it to be
like a disco party or something so we
don't want to make all these different
robots but we want to empower people out
there to do it themselves so that's why
it's so important that robotics is open
you don't you shouldn't have to build
your own motor controllers you know find
your own batteries all that stuff to be
build really cool robotics applications
you really just need to build on top of
a platform that's open and modifiable so
that's our belief is robots robotics
will be changed if that's the way that
people do it rather than this way is so
I don't know to me honestly super
annoying it's also closed today everyone
is hiding everything once a company goes
and spends you know a hundred thousand
two hundred thousand to develop a leg or
an arm they never want to give that away
and so Cambria's about bringing everyone
together in robotic community sharing
everything and then being able to help a
lot of people because of it so yeah so
we want to disrupt the way that robots
are being devolved right now in the
world and really create that you know
collaborative environment so people can
work together ok so we also demoed arm
so this arm is actually can be control
over the Internet as well using my phone
to control here and we make it really
quiet so we have some really powerful
brushless motor technology you should be
able to lift itself do I Drive it ok let
me try
ok so this is gonna be like a really
cool demo that we're planning so
basically like a robot can do a pull-up
right
so this is the key for consumer robotics
has to be has to be lightweight and it
has to be durable I'm sorry I sleep I
sleep the the string okay thank you sign
up out there any questions we were
taking yeah any questions
we're happy to talk about anything
blockchain from our experience or
robotics or anything like that so to me
sushmi one terabyte codes Audrey Cleo
well thanks so much for the talk first
one was that inspired by the KO pot and
second how is manual Veloso helping you
guys cobots so so yes so the idea is we
want to build something that you know
can be collaborate with human right to
be staying alongside of human so
mailable also was our advisor and you
know we we were working with her on the
COBOL idea you know and she has a robot
that was traveling a thousand miles in
Indore and that navigation package is
gonna be released on Cambria and so the
idea is you know she's that you know in
her lap they have a lot of cool tank but
she doesn't know how to commercialize it
right it's just the same with other
robotics is in the world you know but
now Cambria is a way for her to put it
out so that other people can
commercialize it
and she will get a share of the profit
and so that's really a game changer
are you also gonna bring over how we
chose its snake robot
yeah well if we see a good use case yes
then we'll bring it out so that you know
yeah we people can be sounds like you're
very familiar with like all these
project coming out of class of 2011 so
really good to see you
yeah one thing interesting to add on to
that so the name Cambria comes from the
Cambrian explosion that's where there
was all this increase in biodiversity on
earth so our feeling is that if we can
get the conditions right then we can
create that same kind of explosion a lot
of different companies trying this you
know I said I think as took mention the
difference is instead of having to raise
five or ten million which is really hard
for any robot robotics company to raise
that amount of money to deploy it on
something they're not sure about now
they can try it for like 100k or
something like that
that really changes what's possible well
you can try and do so 2003 misses me on
my echo 3 Assunta ok I'll go back to you
I I have a question about your logistics
so say I built an arm in the US and I
have a leg in Thailand or something and
how do you put it together it's a really
simple question yeah that's awesome
question so our thinking is that's why
Cambria manufacturing is built on a set
of manufacturing principles that can be
replicated around the world
so unlike having to go to one factory in
China the goal is that that you know you
saw our printer farm that kind of stuff
is replicable around the world and so we
have partners already in different
places for example Japan who are
interested in setting up that facility
themself and offer that to the local
customers so yeah so the idea is though
if you design down Cambria you should be
able to get it made wherever you are in
the world yeah yes that we're gonna be
on yes so basically a way for different
components to talk to each other right
and you know that we like the API for
hardware and software yeah and the idea
for us is to eliminate a lot of the sort
of supply chain and manufacturing hassle
like for example if I have a supplier
here you have a difference of pilot you
have we have to go look for that you
know every time there's a new part or
anything so the ideas make that uniform
and everything becomes shareable around
the world yeah
so right now so we we building out this
robotics lab around the world so we have
five in a work already and so we're
gonna be able to factory in the box next
to the Rorick laughs so that people can
get prototype and low volume production
together and you know if if they demand
by then we could just crank up the
volume there okay all right
I want to talk about friction between
the blockchain and world and the real
world
I think the rewording system for the
Becker and the developer is really
important for the success of the
platform but at the same time I think it
might be possible for the companies or
manufacturer companies that they can
hide their sales volume so that they can
pay less than what they suppose they are
supposed to pay what do you think about
that yeah that's a great question it's
always tricky to enforce that in the
real world even if you have legal
contracts or anything so the goal I
think with us is to make it a
crowdsource movement so that it's not
just like you know for example Linux
there's a lot of these GPL violations
that no one can prosecute there's no
money in it there's not enough stake in
it the goal is now every token holder if
you're withholding payments from the
system you are damaging the value of the
token and so our hope is that you know
you never want things to go to legal
means right that's sort of the worst
outcome it creates enemies when that
happens but if you can show all the
token holders in the community maybe one
day it's like you know a billion dollars
worth of value is saying you're doing
something wrong then that's a really
strong signal and we want it to be
better and easier just to pay the fee
and come into compliance rather than
have to you know hide and you know like
not be part of this ecosystem not having
anyone like you or support you so that's
like that's our sort of answer to that
yeah thanks yeah but also like you know
if you think about it right the
traditional way is everyone tried a
great because margin is possible and so
everyone's hiding all the stuff right
and then charge you know as high as
possible but we say that's the wrong way
to go for us the new disruptive way is
to actually share that pie right so
everyone's a little bit of a pie but we
make it you know we can move so fast we
can unlock a really big market and so
now the pies is way much bigger and then
everyone has like a big piece of it by
instead of you know you try to keep all
the technology yourself yeah so that's
the way that we want to be able to sell
great question hunger matter what gets
me to recession boon kitchen guy oh okay
there's a question I have a question on
the crypto side of the project so you
mentioned the token sale can you please
elaborate on the role of this token in
the Cambria platform and the crypto
economics in game here yeah so the
tokens can be used for several different
utilities so one is to acquire robotic
service and robotics parks so you know
token holder can buy all of this with
discount early access the second way is
to facilitate all the transaction
between different key stakeholders of
the platform so as if your developers
way then you can use a token to pay for
manufacturing and you know if you
contribute a technology onto the
platform you also get paid in the token
as well it's the licensing fee you know
if people it's commercialize the
technology they will have to pay a
licensing fee back to the platform in
the form of the token so this is the
inflow right driving the demand of the
token and that licensing fee is going to
be split between people who contribute
to the project the robots that being
used whether your backers or your
developers or you know your the company
that licensing out the technology and so
everyone is gonna share this profit
together
thanks guys really excited that just
when I asked the robot builders of the
future in school now and I've seen some
incredible kids twelve-year-old girls
build robots in the UK competing G does
the Foundation have an educational
program and will you provide schools
with access and support yes
so definitely education is a very
important piece of the ecosystem we're
building out these robotics labs already
with universities around the world but
we also try to print AI education to
different parts of the world to train
engineer for AI for robots for example
we're only doing VII in Vietnam bringing
in courses from Stanford and Google so
that to train the engineer in Vietnam
you know to become better at machine
learning deep learning all that but
they're not a sigh of the the whole
equation is we want to make it super
easy for anyone to start building on
robots so thing about like mobile
development like 10 years ago is
actually very hard for you to ride
mobile app you know today you can ride a
mobile app in five minutes right with
all the development kit and so we want
to do exactly the same for robots
so with cambria you can you know
download a kid and then in five minutes
you can see and start writing
hello war robot so that's the vision
that we want to achieve yeah and to add
to that one of the things that we are
sort of passionate about that we figured
out along this way is how to do things
really scrappy and that's really
important for schools that don't have
the budget so for example I'll give you
one example for the PCBs in the robot we
designed them and we went to one of the
big sort of consultants in Silicon
Valley who does this kind of work we
said how much does it cost for you guys
to like you know go and get these boards
turned around for us and made and they
said like ten thousand dollars we say
okay mmm let's think about it then we
went with our own way we found our
supplier in China
make the boards we learn how to pick in
place and get a local assembler and when
we turned that batch of boards for us it
probably costs less than like a thousand
bucks so it's a 10x savings and if you
add all that up
anyone can design PCBs you don't need to
be a special fat house anyone can print
and design mechanical enclosures and
hardware we both of us are personally
passionate about education and educating
the next generation I'd really like to
see a Cambria educational program that
gives people a degree combined
mechanical electrical and software
because we think all the interesting
robotics problems happen at that
intersection so it's not just you know
your mechanical team separate your
electrical team your your software team
but everyone working together all the
time I think will be more powerful and
more productive that way the minitor
yogi Kashi Pataki Sumida Jambo thank you
everyone yeah you thank you thank you
[Applause]
our next speaker is Alexander Larson
from XC infinity so X infinity is a
blockchain based digital pet game
founded with the mission of introducing
fun gameplay and a dynamic player player
run economy to the word of non fungible
tokens Alexander is an experienced video
game broadcaster and rx competitive
gamer Alexander is in charge of the
business and operational side of X
infinity his background in esports and
running gaming tournaments gives us
insights into the world world of
competitive gaming and innovative
monetization strategies that can be
unlocked as the blockchain gaming space
matures
please welcome Alexander hi hello Thank
You Ethan
and first of all Thank You hushed for
having AXI infinity here as he said my
name is Alexander and before we get
started I want to just briefly say how
we met in AXI because it's quite
relevant to the entire space so action
infinity is actually a team that met
playing crypto kitties so if you can
imagine that I am the region
I met the CEO of axe infinity Year who
is sitting right there his name is true
playing crypto kiddies and also our
growth lead and we were so fascinated
with the possibilities of non fungible
tokens and what these tokens could bring
and change possibly the future of gaming
that I decided to quit my job and travel
to Vietnam to be with the axe infinity
team in this presentation I'm going to
talk about the importance of NFC design
and how it has impacted our economy in
acts infinity so it's going to be quite
a lot of focus on the economy side if
you have never heard about actually I'm
going to show a brief trailer and then
we can get started
ACCI infinity is a digital pet community
players can sell their in-game
characters for real money using the
etherium blockchain
players can breed their axes to discover
exciting new combinations axes start off
as eggs and require love and attention
from their owners to grow up
[Music]
take care of your axes and earn
experience points by completing daily
activities
[Music]
use experience points to level up your
axes and unlock new abilities which can
be used in battle you can even trade
your axes for cryptocurrency on our
marketplace
find out more on AXI Infiniti comm
available now
so yeah that trailer was actually
released about in the middle of 2018 or
later part of 2018 but what we started
to realize when we were developing acts
infinity is that a lot of the players
actually wanted to use our non fungible
tokens for more than just the games that
we were creating they actually wanted to
create their own games they wanted to
create their own virtual world and
that's kind of what we realized that we
had to do so instead of just making one
game we are now developing a virtual
world which is called the no sale but
I'm going to talk more about that a
little bit later on the screen here you
can see some numbers and these are quite
significant numbers because what they
signify
is the average amount of money spends
I'm sure some people have other numbers
but these are the numbers that I have
and what you can see is that 20 to 100
to 400 and 400 to 800 dollars $22 is the
gaming industry average 100 to 400 is
the average amount of money a player
spends in a blockchain game given that
it has some amount of success in acts
infinity we see that players spend on
average between $400 and $800 and why is
it that way we believe that it has
everything to do with the way that we
have designed our ecosystem from the
beginning with a focus on NFT design so
this is our framework it's a quite a
simple one we have called it the triple
threat framework it basically states
that to create value for our players and
in our universe whenever we issue an N
of T it needs to be at least limited to
some degree
you cannot Azure 3 mention it's this
presentation if you have an unlimited
amount of assets they're probably going
to be quite worthless in the end if they
also look unique they are more
attractive to players they will be worth
more and the same goes also for utility
and in-game power this is of course a
very sensitive subject in gaming because
if you make it too strong then the fun
amount for players will be kind of
negated because they can just pay to win
to an extent
and in the middle there for some of you
guys might recognize the card it's
called the Black Lotus from Magic the
Gathering one of my favorite games I
played it for actually over seventeen
years now
and it's one of the most powerful cards
in the game it fulfills all of the three
principles that we have so basically
this card is one of the strongest in the
game it's only 1100 copies of it created
ever it's an alpha Black Lotus and the
price of the most expensive one was 168
thousand dollars not sold so long ago so
what we can say is that players they
actually build emotional connection to
all these game characters whether it be
physical objects like this one the Black
Lotus and also some of the game
characters in acts infinity so when we
were designing our axes as you could
hear in the trailer every AXI is a
unique digital pets an e rc 7:21 type of
token which can be used in multiple
games in in our universe all the data is
stored on the ethereum blockchain at the
moment in a 256 bit number and whatever
kind of number that they have it
determines the visual look of the AXI
and how strong they are in battle and
how strong they are in other kind of
games so other people are for example
making different games in the universe
where some genetic data basically
signifies that they are stronger in that
specific game and some axis of course
have exceedingly rare mystic body parts
which I'm going to also go into detail a
little bit later and these could only be
purchased for a limited amount of time
basically making them very very scarce
so far we have about sixty four thousand
axes in existence and the price varies
from about two dollars from the cheapest
and the most expensive one was sold for
over fifteen thousand dollars so this is
a little bit about the AXI infinity
preset which we had in 2018 so for those
of you who are game developers might
wonder well why did people buy our axes
we actually had about 250 players or
investors I should say participate in
this early pre-sale 311 3000
112 axes sold and we raised over 900
ether at the time it was between 500 and
600 thousand dollars so why did people
buy well the axes that you could get
they fulfilled the three principles they
were scarce there have the special
origin tag that could only be purchased
for a limited time they could also
unlock special unique skins and some of
the axes themselves have mystic body
parts and can be upgraded to legendary
ability and as I mentioned this is quite
critical when it comes to gameplay
related parts because the legendary
abilities in the game are exceedingly
strong so we need to balance that out a
little bit later and of course we had a
quite recent referral strategy
whenever you refer someone to the game
and they purchase maxi you gets one
specific token and then you can redeem
these tokens for one axiom and what is
interesting is these tokens that people
could get they are ERC 20 type of tokens
and they have actually appreciated
significant in value so in a way for
those of you guys who are familiar with
Magic the Gathering or card packs if you
have five of these very early tokens you
can redeem them for one specific rare
AXI and this is something now we're also
going to be hammering on in this entire
presentation good nfg design means that
the value is created for the players not
only for the game developer so by
actually capping our supply by actually
saying that we have a limited amount of
creating and creating axes and also
selling axes we can see that people are
more willing to spend money and for
those who you can't really see up there
on the on the right you can see
different kind of axes that were sold
and flipped so basically the value has
increased as time has passed because
more and more players are coming into
the ecosystem and speculating more
because they see that the value of these
assets are becoming they're becoming
more valuable quite simply that is
because they are limited-edition and as
you can see there are only 4077 axes
with the special origin type and only
1345 of them will have one or more
mystic ability the most expensive
actually that was sold it has
believe three mystic mystic parts so why
do they also keep buying it's because of
course it's a social ecosystem that
created that we are creating a community
where people actually lo love to show
off their air assets it's social proof
in a sense if you have a really cool
rare asset not only can you use this and
actually infinity but having this thing
in your wallet also proves that you were
one of the earliest adopters of
blockchain games in general and this is
something that also else mentioned in
his other in his presentation things
they cannot be removed if you have
something that it says that this is a
creation date this is that's it that's
the way it is you can always prove it
and that's kind of the beginning of your
virtual identity on the blockchain so
what was the next step I said it earlier
we needed a place for axes to live and
this is Lughnasa
a virtual world which is of two parts
one is a gameplay part where players
they can harvest different kind of
tokenize resources use your axes on top
of your land and then you can attack
other players attack other resource
nodes and then we have also a virtual
world part which is being created right
now so players if you own the plot of
land you can monetize that with
different kind of experiences and also
host future games on it as time passes
this is of course also limited edition
so by saying that the land itself has
only 19601 available plots were able to
drive the mound but we can also say that
whenever we're selling land we need to
limit ourselves because 90,000 plots of
land is quite a lot when the ecosystem
is so young so maybe we shouldn't sell
90,000 plots at the beginning but we
need to think a little bit ahead so
that's what we did we had a long land
sale in early 2019 where players could
purchase different kind of chests so
it's a gutshot kind of mechanic where
how many chests you open determines of
course how many different kind of items
you're getting but we had a few other
key mechanics that we had in this sale
so every chest you have contains one
land plot so as you can see there on the
top we have what's called a
just in every Savannah church there is
one plot of Savannah lands and a few
other items if you collect every single
item it unlocks a specific exclusive
kind of land which could only be which
is a limited edition as well and the
same goes downwards when you look at the
different kind of lands for sale players
of course have another special kind of
jackpot mechanism which is called which
we created so that even the players who
spend the least amount of money could
also have a chance to find something
that's really valuable so you could open
a chest and then you can find a Genesis
land even by purchasing the cheapest a
chest and the most expensive Genesis
lands for now has sold for over five
thousand dollars and one thing that we
that we designed as well we needed
something to drive the interest so why
would you purchase land what is actually
driving the interests of purchasing
lands so when you look at the map it's
actually 25 percent of the map it's a
little bit dark I can see now but we
only sold 25% of the map at the
beginning 95 percent of all the lands
has been sold out and we have 75 percent
in reserves and we have so far sold for
over 4,000 either so the way that it
works is that if you own the plot of
land next to a resource node and the
player actually attacks the resource
node next to you you are then entitled
to a small amount of resources which
that AXI earned and that's something
that we see a lot of players are very
interested in and also purchasing a lot
of land because not everyone is
interested in actually playing the game
because we're so early on in the
ecosystem that we have a lot of
different kind of investors and most
players are actually crypto players by
now would maybe even define themselves
as investors so when we look at the
marketplace this is our own created
marketplace we believe in owning the
user experience from the beginning to
the end and by only in the user
experience we can also have really great
data and we can also be sure that we
don't churn anyone
because they do things in a way that we
don't like so so far we've had over 17
$700,000 in volume on average every
player trades items for about $400
yearly and we've had over seventeen
thousand dollars in sales and as you can
see the curve is well it's starting to
look pretty good and a big reason for
that is because the players they
actually care about their game assets
you don't get this kind of thing if you
don't really really really careful about
when you issue new kind of assets so as
I mentioned the most expensive axe is
sold for fifteen thousand and we take
4.25 percent commission fee on every
trade which is a part of our business
model so some of our recent growth
metrics we have over two thousand
players now who own and hold axes and so
far there has been over two thousand
seven hundred and twenty two holders we
calculate retention a little bit
differently than most games do and the
way that we calculate retention is by
saying that everyone who still holds an
ACCI but they can sell at any time they
want they are actually a user we don't
necessarily believe in a user who is
sending a transaction to the etherium
blockchain on the daily basis just
because it's too easy to gain that kind
of statistics we care more about the
money and the value that is being locked
in to the ecosystem so we usually have
between six hundred fifty nine visitors
699 visitors on a daily basis to the
website and one between 180 350 send
daily transactions to the etherium
blockchain
but what's most interesting is how much
time do they actually spend in a game
like this so 14 minutes well it is
significant when you look at the current
state of the game because players right
now well they can battle they can beat
but in in reality we're still very early
on in development so here we have what
is the secret behind ax infinity and
what we have been cultivating since the
beginning something that you cannot fake
your way to something that you need to
build by blood sweat and tears you need
to be there
day we have a discord channel we do it
on Twitter we cultivate our community
we're honest with the players we say to
them every day this is what we have this
is what we can offer you guys and we see
that the response has been tremendous we
have a tiered reward system for active
players and active creators so anyone
who actually wants to create content in
AXI infinity they can do that and then
they will get rewarded and what we see
is that a lot of players are creating
amazing content like I'm going to show
you just now
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
[Music]
[Applause]
[Music]
so in general what we can say is that
these kind of things they don't come out
of their own you need to have an active
community you need to have people who
actually care about what you're doing
and then they will start creating things
then they will start to actually stream
for example so streaming as a
distribution channel is something that
we're very focused on because what the
streamers do for example they spread joy
about AXI and they also give them away
of course people love free stuff and
that's actually something that our own
community is providing so actually we
have one player who has donated over
twenty thousand dollars to different
kind of streamers only when they are
playing acts infinity for example why
well because the incentive models
between the players and the developers
are aligned so this is a new way of
actually creating games so what we see
from the regular gaming industry is that
their goals as game developers in
general are to milk the players for as
much money as they possibly can in
blockchain games it's a different kind
of model if we keep milking the players
if we say that yes today you're gonna
get this special offer oh and tomorrow
you're gonna get this special offer and
the day after that is another special
offer nobody actually cares what you're
making anymore you need to be consistent
and say that yes we're going to give you
this and that's kind of it and then you
guys can trade among each other so what
we've seen is that more so than just
making content and streamers as I
mentioned they have a third-party
developer community and this third-party
developer community they are actually
using these axion Finity NFT assets to
create different kinds of games even so
this on the bottom right here is called
axis Russia it is a racing game where
players who use your web three bullets
if you have an ACCI in your wallet you
can participate in the sushi racing game
you participate against other players
and then you can win small prizes which
is air-dropped by other community
members they are also making different
kind of wiki's like you can see on top
there it's called axis
WorldCom so feel free to visit that site
whenever you want they have old updated
guides all the updated tools that are
available in ax infinity and this is
also something that's community-created
and as I said they are stakeholders they
actually believe in what we're making
and they also gain actually by spreading
the word of accid because if they can
get more players into the game their
assets also become worth more so what is
next as I said we have been building
this since early on in 2018 at the time
there was only a serum at the time the
anything that you wanted to do you had
to do on a web-based application now we
are making a mobile application and
players will be able to login using
their email they will be able to play
without paying gas we're already taking
the first steps they're working tightly
with loon network as a sidechain to e
theorem and this is how the internal
alpha is looking
[Music]
and that's just the beginning as we can
as we are keeping on developing this
application we're also building out the
world a vaccine and what we see is a
play to earn is a big drawing factor for
many many players but we could not do
this in a meaningful way before the
reason for that is people are bottling
of course people are trying to make
money in a very easy way unless we can
have some time constraints for players
where they actually have to spend time
in the game we cannot allow them to make
too much as you say resources in our
game and as was mentioned in the
presentation I come from an eSports
background I don't necessarily believe
that we can make the game into an
eSports immediately but what we can do
is facilitate for competition and what
we can do is seed the eSports
environments and let players actually
compete and we're now also seeing that
our own players are creating different
kind of tournaments in axing and this
one is probably the most important thing
the do Nasia SDK is what we're making to
facilitate more in the realm of a
virtual world where we need to harness
the power of the user-generated content
so we're creating a very easy to use
framework so that we can act as a
distribution model for other kind of
game developers and also amateur gamers
who want to participate in the Axia
infinity ecosystem but what we see is
that we have all these players and we
have all these assets who are worth so
much money we need to allow other
players to create content so that we can
capture value from that as well and that
they can also partake in the value that
is being created in the AXI infinity
ecosystem so if we allow players to
issue tokens both fungible and non
fungible in the action infinity universe
you can kind of see where this leads
revenue sharing contracts using smart
contracts is also a natural next step
and of course modifying the existing AXI
assets with different kind of hats
similar to what you see in a sea
marketplace for example and the last one
advanced programming tools what we
believe in an ACCI is that
players need to be able to create games
whether they are professional game
developers or simple like normal people
like me but they just want to kind of a
partake in the in the universe but of
course advanced programming tools need
to come as well so yeah thank you if you
guys have any questions feel free to ask
[Applause]
hi there i'm hamish the growth and
community leader openc and it's a
pleasure to be chatting to your nfd
roadshow career of nfts and all things
openc
obviously career is well known to be
sort of a center of innovation on the
blockchain so it's really nice for us to
get the opportunity to present openc and
talk to you about our future plans
so our mission is to build an open
digital economy and we're excited about
a brand new type of digital good called
non-functional token
from people selling records at
christie's auction house to nfl
superstar rob gronkowski making history
on opencv i'm sure you've all heard
about nfps
they've been fairly hard to avoid
recently to be fair
so
for those that aren't familiar just
quickly nfts are digital goods stored on
the blockchain they're unique provably
scarce tradable and usable across
multiple applications
and just like the physical goods you can
do whatever you want with them you can
throw them in the trash give them to a
friend or sell them on an open
marketplace like openc
and one of our core goals is enabling
vibrant new economies for creators and
collectors on open protocols like
ethereum so with that in mind we've
built tools that allow consumers to
trade their assets freely creators to
distribute new digital works knowing
they'll receive royalties every time
their entities are sold and developers
to build rich integrated marketplace for
for digital items so here's a bit of
background on how it all started so in
2017 the world witnessed the birth of
cryptokitties a blockchain based game
centered around breedable collectible
creatures i'm sure some of you have
still got cryptokitties in your in your
messy mask and not familiar with the
story so at the time our founders devin
finzer atlantis teller saw the need for
a marketplace for this new type of
digital asset and started building open
sea and skip forward to 2021 and some of
the biggest friends and celebrities in
the world are joining a growing pool of
talented internet creators and using
open seats and make and distribute nfgs
just recently we've had coca-cola
launching collectibles on openc and
exploring the sort of digital strategy
on the blockchain we've had nba teams
like the golden state warriors
distributing sports collectibles to
their fans around the world and we've
also had pop stars like shawn mendes
partnering with another company this
place called genies to launch a
collection of avatars so you can really
see the diversity in the range of assets
there we've got musicians sports teams
big brands like coca-cola um really
exploring the potential of this asset so
with opencv being such an open
marketplace there really is scope for
every kind of company and every kind of
creator to
to generate revenue on the blockchain
and this is a really interesting use
case we're seeing emerge now so on the
platform we have a really diverse set of
assets we've got digital art sports
collectibles
uh virtual worlds items coca-cola even
actually just explored the sort of
decentralized virtual world and so you
can really see these sort of brands and
all kinds of
independent creators looking to explore
the communities and really understand
this new evolving world
so here's a look at the sort of the
numbers and that's the market overview
as it were so it's clearly growing and
as reported by coindesk there were 2.5
billion dollars worth of nft sales in
the first half of 2021 compared to just
13.7 billion in the first half 2020. so
from open seas perspective our monthly
sales volume in july 2020 was one
million dollars but in july 2021 we saw
over 300 million sales across the
platform
uh elsewhere the number of active
traders on opc is now 20 times higher
than it was at this point last year so
those two numbers really show you the
sort of scope of growth and the
surge in demand that we've seen over the
last year such a short period of time
for that level of growth
and
so kind of looking into our approach and
how we've been successful and we
understand that success is only possible
with a collaborative community focused
approach so it wasn't always like this
it wasn't always crazy growth um so we
had two or three years uh building in a
sort of crypto bear market as it were
and so we really learned to listen to
the community
and appreciate those sort of core users
that were using the platform and build
the platform with their thoughts and
concerns and feedback in mind and
because
one of the things we found is that
obviously because it's such an
innovative new space and so much scope
potential and we don't have all the
answers so i think listening to that
like sort of wider perspective is really
important
and with that in mind sort of staying
agile and keeping the roadmap flexible
is really important obviously roadmaps
are great and need to understand what
your vision is long term what your plans
are for the next few months but as the
market changes around us it's really key
for us to to keep flexible listen to
feedback make changes based on what
we're seeing in the market and a great
example of that is at the start of the
year gas prices were really high um but
our development team and our founders
found a way to make it so that artists
could make nfts for free and that really
made a difference because before that
there was a bit of a sort of upfront
cost from a network transaction for your
point of view to get started so making
that process free and really really
helped us grow and really like helped
independent artists get their work on
the blockchain for the first time too so
here's a look at our roadmap from q4
202020 and beyond
and so integrating other blockchains is
a core part of our growth plan as new
technologies are all around us it's
important that we respond to market
demand and sort of listen to what's
happening in terms of other other
opportunities and other chains recently
we integrated with polygon blockchain
the polygon sighting to launch a gas
free marketplace where nft creators and
artists all around the world can earn
their way into crypto for the first time
so that's quite a big positive step for
us that an artist can come to work and
see making a nifty sell it um and then
get crypto without having had any before
so they're sort of earning their way
into the market um which is a really
good really good thing for independent
artists
that don't necessarily understand crypto
or understand how to get it before they
get started
and we've also integrated with clayton
the korean blockchain so our strategy is
all about exploring other opportunities
and finding out where the other markets
are and really just supporting those
chains for all kinds of
trading um
so with that in mind sort of a better ux
is is one of our key key goals i think
the crypto space in general suffers from
sort of user experience sometimes so
um improving your user experience and
reducing crypto related friction is key
to the health of not only our platform
but the wider industry so that will
obviously lead to more adoptions as
people come to openc and we've got the
user experience really improving
understanding what's wrong with it how
we can make it better we think that will
lead to more stickiness in terms of our
user growth and people will be coming
back to
also as a leader in a new industry it's
important that we sort of take
responsibility responsibility for
educating and supporting new existing
users and that will also help us
increase our adoption increase our
attention of those users
because obviously in this sort of world
there's a lot of user safety concerns
it's kind of decentralized it's very
different to sort of normal existing
website markets so it's our
responsibility to really lead from the
front on that
and um and help people into the
marketplace and help people understand
this new world that we're building
and yeah that's it so thank you for
listening and if you're intrigued to get
started you want to buy an nft head to
open io if there any developers
marketers community managers in the
audience are curious about joining the
team and we've obviously we're hiring as
well as we grow so thank you again
hello pastries thank you so much for
joining us here at hush'd I would like
to start by introducing you to our
global audience so could you just tell
us some of the roles that you're
currently involved in at the European
Commission I'm head of unit for digital
innovation and blockchain which in
addition to blockchain obviously also
includes the start of EU project and
also innovation radar coordination of
ICT standards innovation procurement and
access to finance for startups and scale
ups and I'm also co-chair of the FinTech
task force sharing with my colleagues
from financial markets the digital
single market perspective to enabling
FinTech so that's possible actually so
what are some of the important agendas
that you're trying to pursue with
utilizing your goals of these well we're
implementing blockchain utilizing the
partnership with 30 European countries
building a European blockchain services
infrastructure already starting to roll
out this year in reg tech regulatory
reporting and certification of audit
documents with self sovereign identity
and certification of individual diplomas
coming afterwards we do that together
with the Member States you could say in
a regulatory sandbox so also learning
while we're doing we're seeing if we
find any regulatory barriers or if there
are any places where there would be
needed legal clarity or a pro innovation
initiative also in startup Europe and
the access to finance we're launching
vehicles like an artificial intelligence
blockchain investment fund and also an
investment fund for helping small and
medium enterprises to digitalize
that's a few of the things and on that
you've mentioned some of the regulatory
obstacles that you're trying to Iza for
these new enterprises could you give us
some specific examples and how you've
done well up until now we've been
hesitant to rush in with any regulation
first of all we try to be technology
neutral and to be future proofed with
our regulation as we don't have a
regulation on servers or regulation on
transistors we don't think there needs
to be a regulation on blockchain that
said some of the inputs from the
community for example the latest GU
blockchain observatory and forum working
groups paper on legal aspects of
blockchain and smart contracts indicates
that some work might be needed in the
area of tokens and smart contracts but
again if they were to be approached and
this will be a political decision down
the line they should be approached in
such a way that these decentralized
tools could be used on future
technologies and you also don't lock
people in to blockchain or distributed
ledger technologies or a narrow
definition of one of the two or three
understood so you've mentioned a lot of
great initiatives and when you try to
look at the EU's approach to block
I noticed that there are a lot of
emphasis that are being placed on public
good
and such as identity health data data
management data sharing what is the EU
stance on businesses and utilized
blockchain and what are some of the
policy angles that you try to go for in
supporting that well one of the things
was that I mentioned the European
blockchain services infrastructure again
we don't want to try to squeeze in the
market or squeeze the market we want to
let the free market and the creativity
and the innovation flourish but at the
same time we think that a state public
service infrastructure can also be a
launch pad for private initiatives
historically we see things like the
internet for example which which all
utilize now and is which has been the
basis for a who of e-commerce so if we
talk about this area we thought that our
intervention should be on public
services also reg tech which helps those
who are doing the reporting whether
they're banks or eventually those are
someway regulated by environmental
legislation but I do have to underline
that the European blockchain partnership
declaration has also an article
foreseeing a public-private partnership
so on the basis of the same
infrastructure which is shared now by 30
countries we can do something together
with the private stakeholders this will
be probably a bottom of proposition
coming either from Member States with
stakeholders or stakeholders to us and
the Member States so we'll have to see
what the first use case would be the
first use cases I already mentioned the
public service ones are launching this
year at the end of this year we'll have
a second yet of use set of use cases
which will be approved which might still
be the public service ones but I expect
the collaboration with the private
sector to come in the near future and at
the same time with our thinking about
the regulatory framework not having
rushed in to regulate yet
looking to see whether there are
interventions needed in the future it
has also been with the idea to let the
creativity of the private sector and
innovation flourish I think it's really
important for us to remember that there
needs to be a cooperative model between
the public and the private as you've
mentioned and I think it's really
important for the uptake of the industry
and I know that there is the
International Association for trusted
launching application as well could you
tell us a little bit more about the
initiatives behind that movements that
was an idea as I mentioned we organized
with the member states this European
walk chain partnership but then more and
more people from the private sector and
the private sector globally were saying
to us well how will you interact other
than sporadically and punctually with
individual stakeholders with the private
sector and we with some of the
interested parties brought together a
meeting my Commissioner Mary a Gabrielle
and had a roundtable of businesses
interested in blockchain primarily from
Europe and North America though from the
very beginning there were Asian
companies and we very much would be very
happy to see Korean companies as well as
country companies elsewhere
and IH that take part there's a couple
of Japanese companies and I think at
least one Chinese company already so
this is something that also on this trip
and one of the reasons why I've come too
late I have to say my first trip to to
to Korea so it's too late I should have
probably been there long ago with all
the dynamic things going on in this
country is to encourage the private
stakeholders as well as our counterparts
in the government to collaborate and the
really the idea is a little bit to give
a stakeholders voice at the global level
whether you're talking with us at the
European Command
with the German government with the
Canadian government with Australians
with the u.s. with your own government
here in Korea with the Japanese
government that this would be something
and a very flexible and inclusive
approach so again the message is very
much we'd be very glad to see the Asian
stakeholders coming in and even taking a
leadership role in the next board of
board of directors elections and how to
say proposing themselves to be among the
leaders right well we'll try to make
sure to follow up with great I want to
switch gears and instead of just talking
about blockchain I want to have a little
bit of conversation about cryptocurrency
the EU is not exactly a hostile about
they're not 100% supportive of
cryptocurrency
either and I think it's because there
are inherent risks associated with it so
from the European Commission's
perspective or the regular regulators
perspective how can you balance
innovation and also responsibility and
accountability in facing
cryptocurrencies well I mentioned this
FinTech task force that I'm co-chair of
and we had a FinTech action plan that
was adopted and that has produced among
other things a fin tech lab this
European blockchain initiative that I've
been talking about a regulation on
crowdfunding which is very much meant at
enabling crowdfunding and it also has a
section on as we kind of officially
formally called them crypto assets
because the reading of the European
Central Bank was that none of them
function like a currency right now up
until now so you see in the text there
that as you mentioned the risks are
there but also that the very much the
positive benefits they could be accrued
by raising finance more easily for small
and medium enterprises also for
innovative initiatives by larger
enterprises are there
and we are looking hopefully from our
side to help and shaping the crypto
assets the market in a way that it can
bring perhaps better access to finance
more liquidity that said we have taken a
relatively neutral position you could
say about specific crypto assets like
like Bitcoin not trying to to my mind
not something feasible prohibited for
instance but on the other hand it would
be difficult to endorse it because the
only currency of the euro area is the
euro and we have all kinds of assets and
commodities and crypto assets I think
have their place there but we've been
trying again try to take the approach
that's not heavy-handed and not trying
to do things that are not feasible
but at the same time not encouraging
risk-taking or speculation which at
least part of the market and in
cryptocurrency it has been and I think
in being able to have a regulatory
framework that could work not only
within the EU level but globally I think
it's really important to have either a
legal taxonomy at least harmonized so
you've mentioned that the year looks at
it has
there are some jurisdictions that would
get it as virtual assets digital assets
and there are a lot of variances that
exists
how would you inspire convergence and I
know that Cambridge recently published a
regulatory landscape study and in which
they proposed that harmonization do you
have any opinion well we have a couple
of models that are already within the
European Union and the European Economic
Area in Malta in France and in
Liechtenstein which is the EEA which is
our larger group of countries which are
also in the European blockchain
partnership also the report of the
European securities markets Authority
proposes that there could be an EU level
framework or discusses it in their
report so this is again being looked at
there's analysis going on financial
markets colleagues have a study going on
the security tokens or tokens as
securities as well as in the payments
area and then we have this report on the
legal aspects of blockchain including
smart contracts and what we consider to
be utility tokens or consumer tokens and
then there's another study with our
financial markets colleagues which is
this is all coordinated also on these on
these utility tokens so you would see
which is public that vice-president
Ambrosius is now an executive vice
president in the next commission has as
one of the tasks to look at the crypto
assets and including in this the stable
coins so I mean there will be a
political decision at a point does this
need a new framework but it is very much
the subject of analysis and as I say
obviously why wanting to protect the
investor and the consumer as well as
they are today the spirit is a pro
innovation one and to try to take the
benefits from these technology advances
but also making sure that it's not
- a failure of consumer confidence
because of some is a failure in you know
an asset and I think that you're really
right to touch on the consumer
protection aspect because I think that's
one of the major concerns and I think
for to be able to protect that then we
also need to have legal certainty around
the regime and because I know that you
also have a legal background so what are
some of the nuanced or even new talent
legal challenges that the blockchain
brings and how would you recommend to
you well first of all I mean I'd say
because it's a new technology this is
also the technology neutral approach
doesn't mean it changes everything
so fraud is fraud a lack of transparency
or market manipulation is market
manipulation these kinds of things can
be applied investor protection the same
with consumer protection if the thing is
let's say promising something and then
is defective or is something else these
same principles need to be applied to a
great extent the existing instruments
probably fix may require adjustments I
mentioned the study that the colleagues
are undertaking in financial markets in
relation to instruments like like method
and the prospectus regulation so this is
being looked at on the side of the
things that are the utility consumer
tokens we see great opportunities
especially for running decentralized
systems with native tokens for instance
managing the data that's coming from the
Internet of Things and linking it to the
processing and analytic capabilities of
artificial intelligence implementing the
management of the data according to the
citizens the consumers wishes whether
this is gdpr for us in our jurisdiction
the California privacy law their other
laws in other jurisdiction but then
getting to what can be different as I
said as a technology of such blockchain
or or DLT are not the last technology so
we shouldn't have to say
lock ourselves in to that as a
technological horizon but probably the
decentralizing element and then this at
least for us we see it as a continuum
obviously something that's in the hands
of one or two players is relatively
centralized something that is like
Bitcoin or etherium is very
decentralized and some other models but
in between for instance this european
blockchain partnership will start with
nodes in the 30 countries at the
european commission possibly at the
european court of Auditors who are also
participating this eventually in the
future i mean it'll be a political
decision the Member States knows the
other could go to the municipal and the
regional level so actually for
cross-border
regulatory public service cooperation
very decentralized but citizens will be
using the services and receiving
benefits and services but they won't be
validating controlling the system this
will be a classic public service model
but again a very multi-level governance
and very distributed so this is this is
also different this is why I say this
project then of the European blockchain
services infrastructure is like a
regulatory sandbox and we're learning
while we're doing and we're seeing where
we don't need perhaps a a new regulatory
framework because we apply time-tested
principles to the new technology but
when you
move into the very decentralized part of
it which we also want to encourage we
see this as something that's innovative
that can have benefits for the economy
for the citizens and also globally but
on the other hand how do you balance
this with investor protection consumer
protection not a greater level it's not
a reason that we need to have greater
strictness that we've had up until now
because at least work or relatively I
think happy with a model that's in in
the European Union but ensuring that if
there is a failure that it's not simply
the answer no one is responsible because
if we also look to the future and we
want take-up you're not going to have
take-up by the common citizen and
probably the mainline industries
nevermind going to ones that are very
sensitive like health energy things to
do with security if the answer is if
there's a data breach instead of
reporting people will just have their
hands up and say that that no one's
responsible it's not impossible it is a
little bit of an intellectual exercise
and again we haven't rushed in I mean
we've been aware of and engaging with
blockchain and FinTech since around 2013
so not perhaps it at the very beginning
some colleagues noticed Bitcoin perhaps
right away but when we started really
having some papers out and in-depth
discussions it was about that time so
some time back and there has not been a
rushed except for as I mentioned the
crowdfunding regulation which was meant
to enable these kinds of platforms to
rush in and just do something and then
again as I always underline I mean our
commissioners are the political level we
have a new set of Commissioners coming
in
hearings right now we have a new
president so it'll be their decision as
well whether we move but you do see some
indications in their mission letters
most of all positive for the
Commissioner designate that I would work
for Silvia Google and for a vice
president BAE sticker you see both the
opportunities of the digital economy and
blockchain specifically as an emerging
technology that should be supported so I
guess you are so globally connected and
at the vanguard of the industry almost
what do you anticipate at the next 10
years would look like and what are some
of the ideal outcomes that you
personally would like to see this is
this is dangerous to me predicting the
future hi I think we're very optimistic
about the application of blockchain to
areas like supply chain intellectual
property protection anti counterfeiting
maybe a little bit more work to be done
but really perhaps implementing the
citizens the consumers right to be
controlling their data this is coming up
I think including from from your CEO at
hashed and several of the other speakers
we also see this this is where we see
the tokens and the smart contracts
playing a role and having a more
decentralized data economy than the
platform economy that we have now again
if this will be controlled by every
single citizen in a completely
decentralized format or at least a more
competitive situation than we have now
that's very difficult to say I would
guess something between the two more
likely but ideally not controlled by one
or two players and every
buddy just how to say morning there that
their data in I think you will probably
see some Central Bank digital currencies
I think complementing them some private
ones especially for things perhaps like
like remittances you have cases where
you really do have a very slow process
and I know some of our national
politicians are trying to push the
commercial banking sector as well to
perhaps offer a more technological a
more seamless seamless service I mean
better for Senate it's up to the private
sector so this is a case where there
could be some I think a very positive
positive disruption and this is now
going up more on a loom but I mean I
think the blockchain really could be a
fundamental if not the fundamental layer
of the next generation internet a more
decentralized internet one that is
working more controlled by the citizens
called controlled by many actors in the
society merging together a lot with
artificial intelligence IOT
decentralized big data the cloud
obviously and ideally again in a way
that is dispersed so that the creativity
of not just let's say individual
citizens in a developed country or
countries but really globally is is
allowed is allowed to flourish and
that would be the ideal and hopefully
we're going in that direction well I
completely and inspired by that vision
as well and that's part of the reason
why I'm in the industry because I think
it allows on an individual level to be
more empowered than we have been
previously before so hopefully luck is
the future we're headed so I like to end
today's interview with you by just
thanking you and as part of the
signature move at hashed this is the
brand that we do so I was wondering if
you could do it with me to say thank you
and I am I doing it correctly so like
yeah facing the other way the other way
there we go okay so hot all right thank
you thank you
[Applause]
[Applause]
and this is Miranda and it kept eyes
teacher currency currency we have been
already us sturgeon with the carbon is
from 2016 in West ICO but compared to
the back one for changing around us for
years right now with Hawaii who has
taken along 17 project along and
including there we have a Tony data for
the same petitioner and also that and
also we invested the has him a mistake I
thought found a table kinda thought and
also another
project and we are also they're one of
the biggest traders in space
oh maybe maybe an opponent of what came
along
hi thanks Simon it's really honored to
be here
and since far you know popular hashed
and we are strong strongest after
mercury in South Korea so we're crypto
found we started the public on trading
in 2015 and we started to invest i ce
o--'s in 2016 so the first project we
invest was new until now we have
invested more than 70 projects so we
have we have a focus in the fundamentals
of the projects so we invest in new
projects like elf and definitive and we
also invested in centralized
decentralized exchanges like timer 0 ass
and also we invested we are you know we
we invest in the stable point we her
down so you know fox we we are also you
know we it's our honor to be here you
know to be all of you here so to meet
all the developers and all the founders
here so if you guys have any
just endure all good projects as we can
talk about it era yeah so and I think
we're marking is just like China and I
think in general and I around him in the
u.s. telling people users right now and
also I thought it five million users in
Korea now right now right now I need a
near future when it's one year
Alyssia busy and I think there will be
more product come from creative lunch
and fall on the comic app we can see a
lot of problems channel choreographer
better polymers when others so this is
also the reason why we came here in the
which mine too
can't you be here to to sponsor to
sponsor some new stops in Korea and
learn from your committee and we already
have as John as John position in China
market and also in the US the US market
we try to be a prayer in the pre-market
learn from also died from cancer
[Applause]
yep okay all right
okay so good evening everyone I think
he's quite challenging that you guys are
staying here for three hours that's
amazing I have never sat in the same
classroom for three hours so I think you
guys were you know a round of applause
for yourself thank you for coming yeah
okay cool um yeah so very nice to be
here
my name is Julie I'm a co-founder of elf
which is the words first decentralized
cloud computing platform here together
with me I also have my co-founder cowboy
and his city right over there he's a
great Chinese speaking presenter but
unfortunately English not so much Korean
even worse right yeah so I will be the
main presenter today and after that
we're you know more than welcome for any
questions you guys have okay so this is
our first time actually to introduce elf
to this market although hashed is one of
the investors for us but we think you
know officially we would like to pay a
visit for this important market to meet
the people here so that you know we can
explain what exactly what we're doing
and what L stands for okay so before I
get into that just a quick story about
the name elf you may wonder okay so what
does that mean why a and E you know and
you sometimes it gets together so what
exactly does it mean right so there was
a short story about it so at the very
beginning our project is called greed gr
ID because that resonates with the
overall structure that we represent
which is a multi-layer multi-chain
structure so he looks like a grid but
along the way that you know so because
we took some time to prepare for this
project so another project came out
which is called grid plus and it has
been it was already you know in the
place for some time that's why we
thought okay we don't want to be too
similar new to something else
that's why we decide to change the name
and
as the co-founders I am a I am a
Starcraft player is there any Starcraft
player here no okay okay cool yeah
thanks for that
but how boi is a Warcraft player yeah so
we're talking okay so how can we get the
name right so we end up with something
that called elf which we take the
inspiration from you know one of the
races from Warcraft so the leader offs
yeah that's how the name gets right okay
okay so before I get into this so I
think just now FBG has already explained
you know and also hashed all of them
just like us has been in this field for
some time so we have seen no big changes
since 2016 yeah before that there was a
colored coin and other stuff but
starting from 2016 that's where we start
to see no more interesting stuff about
blockchain you know where people start
to think about besides just being a p2p
payment system what else can blockchain
do i think bitcoin has done a great job
showing that you know a trustless p2p
payment system really works but etherium
is the first one that brings in a
generic computing platform that is
essentialist
and also can host different d apps on
top of that so that unleashes much more
potential of what can be decentralized
and how to transform business models in
that direction right that's why we see
also you know in terms of the market cap
we see a very nice you know curve going
up especially i think last year into
september that was how confident to the
market is and there are so many great
ideas you know floating around in the
market right all of a sudden you still
you people start asking you know that's
a really is is idea and everything you
know probably we need more right that's
I think in this year what we believe is
this is the this is the year that actual
products actual business values will
really come into this dispute we already
started city central line you know they
already have their their product working
you know they're already showing you
know many things can be done here yeah
so on top of these applications what
will be the next generation of computing
system why we think it will be focusing
on really fulfill different commercial
okay to to really have a performance
that meets the commercial requirements
you know because we're now talking about
much more much larger customer base
we're talking about different businesses
having different requirements we're
talking about a much faster moving pace
where things can get fixed much faster
things get improved and also we're
talking we're looking at you know so
four different changes probably there
will be a communication system that
unites them so that's where alph wants
to be now we want to be the next
generation we want to be on top of a
generic computing platform we want to be
the genero we want to be the
decentralized cloud computing network
that fulfills commercial usage I mean so
what we see here is in the in the
blockchain system right now there are
three main issues number one I think
this is very common for everyone so the
scalability issue what does it mean is
if you really want to want to want to
serve thousands or tens of thousands of
customers on a blockchain right now
that's not feasible that's why people
always start who that that's also the
the constraint you know some great ideas
cannot is not happen has not happened in
the field yet and the second part is
about resource segregation what does it
mean is right now if you consider
blocking as one
of roads all the cars meaning all the D
abs they are fighting for one name so
that's very difficult as a developer I
don't have control of the lane that I'm
moving so for example we look at cryptic
ad that is one of the successful use
case on a theorem right now but you also
creates problems for the other D apps
because they cannot perform if cryptic
ad is performing so it helps if you
separate the computing resources for
different D apps so that they do not
interfere with each other and the third
part is about governance I think there
has been many experiments on blockchain
in terms of Technology in terms of the
ideology but also more experiments will
happen in the future so how do you make
sure that there is a certain way of
consensus to ensure the community is
united and make decisions when it's
needed Bitcoin has been discussing what
is the best solution for scalability for
some time more than one year right I
think it's good you know for open
discussion but also sometimes it's also
important to do experiments to make
mistakes learn from it so a certain way
of decision making process we have
certainly helped that
yeah so this year we already see
starting from last year already see you
know different ideas of how blocking
system would happen in this field so
what I see is I see three scenarios the
first one is we see some of the chains
by having one so a single chain
structure so they're gonna start to
improve themselves saying that okay so I
can work on scalability I can also for
few different business requirements I
can do everything I become the ultimate
winner that serves all different
purposes so I call that it's an empire
it becomes an empire that basically do
not need help from any other chains
Bastille you know become the champion
okay so the second thing that scenario
is actually different chains which is
what happening right now so they all
start working their different
characteristics so some of them will be
more focusing on security some are
privacy some may be for scalability then
on top of that a protocol that is trying
to unite them that lets them to speak to
each other so that kind if you consider
each of the chain as one Kingdom
this becomes the United Nation so for
example maybe coked-out is you know
doing that way right and what do we see
here okay if we wanna you know have a
more structured way for blockchain
system a third option would be that we
also absorbed a multi chain structure
but all of them actually has the same
fundamental architecture behind it and
each of them campers can still reserve
certain characteristics for their own
but they are also interlinked across
among them so in this case you can see
each of the chains as one Federation as
one state but all of them are linked and
formed one single ecosystem under the
same Constitution
and that forms a federation so for elf
whatever take E is the third third
approach in our own ecosystem
you know we allow different chains using
our technology and they can keep certain
characteristics of their own
yeah another observation here is if we
look at most of the blockchain systems
right now they have thousands of nodes
so those are the computers that is
across the globe right but what
ultimately executes all the D apps the
smart contracts is actually go down to
one computer so you imagine you have
thousands of computers performing the
work but the performance goes down to
one computer and that limits you know
how complicated the smart contracts can
be in that case that's why for us while
the general a lot of the ideas that were
in that goes into elf is we bring in the
cloud computing capability and
architecture into blockchain system so
instead of having so instead of having
all the other transactions being
performed by every single computer and
one by one we put them separately into
different groups and allow them to be
processed in parallel so what it means
is increase the computational capability
okay so in a nutshell before we go into
the details yeah so what is elf is it
brings three key innovations so number
one is we have a main chain plus side
chain architecture so different D apps
will be running on different chains they
do not interfere with each other so
that's how we achieve the resource
segregation he also helps to increase
the scalability and number two is about
improving the computational power so
that's where we bring in the parallel
processing capability so that the whole
node system becomes a cloud computer
instead of just one computer and the
last part is about having a preset
consensus system so that token holders
can make decisions on
I'm Ching governance so what it means is
they can true they can vote for what are
the capable notes to perform the work
and for technical features whether those
are desirable to be added on to the
system so we want the system to be self
evolving and we start to see other there
are already some projects already
working on that because making sure
there's a self evolving capability is
important nothing is perfect at the very
beginning right okay so the first thing
is okay so how do we achieve resource
segregation yeah so on the top you see
is basically all the different use cases
and the apps running on one blockchain
so this production does token insurance
and also performs gaming and insurance
and other stuff so if we go back to the
time where bank or DD ICO
actually the whole blocking has what is
not capable of performing anything else
for hours and also thinking about
cryptic ad so if I look from a
developer's point of view actually
that's undesirable because I can build
really good the apps but I have no
guarantee and control of what's
happening if other the apps are also
performing well which is out Billy you
know the go for blockchain that's why
for us we believe it's better to have
one chain two for one smart one smart
contract so we could have side chains
that is only for information
registration and change that is only for
token assurance so if an elf
there are ICS or token sales are ongoing
that will happen on the digital
assurance chain while the other chains
will not be congested and this also
helps you know to organize the different
industries so that they can have their
dedicated places
and they can share some of if it gets
really congested there's also a option
of going even one layer deeper so that
they can have multiple sub layers okay
so but how do you ensure that you know
what happened on all the side chains
will be correctly registered that's why
for our architecture the main chain
actually does not process any smart
contract but it acts as observer it
takes the mercury route of all the side
chains so that it becomes a verifier
that really gets them on what has
happened what other transactions has
been done on each side chain and side
chains they cannot do their own
communication but every time if they
need a verification they refer to the
main chain and they can see okay what
other transactions really happened over
there
and in order to build a multi-chain
structure we actually make the whole
chain as a template so there is a
dedicated place where you can put your
smart contract in and you can you can
even customize the consensus protocol so
what it means is companies if they're
more comfortable of using their own
consensus or using a private chain they
don't need to build the block chain from
scratch they can use alpha architecture
right away but just need to put the
consensus code in there so for the
overall ecosystem of alph you're going
to see a lot of side chains that are
which are public and sharing the same
consensus protocol and some side chains
are some private chains will also be
collected with us and they will also be
verified by the main chain
yeah so what do we have done just now is
actually if you think from a highway
point of view we have changed from one
lane highway to multiple highway to
multi lanes right but the other thing
here is this needs much more powerful
computational power yeah so that's why
we don't think you know beam
transactions being processed to one by
one is the most efficient way anymore
that's why we have introduced a task
scheduler so what it does is before all
the transactions being processed there
will be first scanned and identify what
are the independent transactions we look
at the input and output range making
sure that they do not overlap with each
other so easily you can put them into
independent groups after that the
different groups will be fed into
different clusters of computers so they
process the transactions in parallel ok
yeah so what we're doing here is
actually making each of the roads
smoother so that transactions can go
through much faster and that the key
challenge here is always how do you do
how do you scan and determine the
transactions are independent at the very
beginning and you need to define what
are the special cases if you cannot
determine their independence in your
first time because you do not wanna stop
or delay the block formation time so
there's a balance between you know how
did how refined your groups are and how
fast you know that task can be done yeah
so this is an illustration of how we see
it so all the transactions actually
shared the same p2p layer and storage
but way it goes to all the transactions
goes into the nodes actually that's
where the the grouping happens and they
will be done in parallel the same the
similar idea of AWS or as
or in this case it's decentralized so
that creates the computing platform for
all the apps yep and yeah this is an
illustration of because we're running
our multi chain and so you'll see
communication that is within the chain
and also communication across chains and
only if they need to need to do a
verification they will refer to the main
chain otherwise a p2p works in that way
and in order to speak to other chains we
are also doing adaptors to some of the
most use for block chains so including
Bitcoin and also ethereum in that case
ok the last part is about the consensus
yeah so I like to use an analogy here so
I think building a any any product you
know right now the design thing is
always about fast prototyping you try
your idea that you fail fast but also in
the key thing here is you feel fast but
you also have a way to fix it fast right
so if you consider this is elf system
you have the main chain you have all the
different side chains some of them may
have some technical feature that needs
upgrade right so here people vote for it
if there's new technology people were
saying ok I want it so we should upgrade
some of the chains so the token holders
actually vote for it but there will be
changes that it says you know I am happy
with what I have and I don't want to
upgrade anymore but the whole community
actually thinks you know that's not the
best for the society so they might be
voted out so that's where you see you
know the breakage that they will get
voted out so that introduced a
computation because sometimes you have
similar smart contracts that does
similar things but some of them might be
more
active in terms of operating yeah so you
know nutshell
so what elf breathing is number one the
resource segregation by by having a
multi-chain structure so different smart
contracts will be hosted on different
chains and number two in order to host
such a more complex system we introduced
cloud computing capability by having
task scheduler to group transactions and
process them in parallel and the last
part is to give in the gap unchain
governance to the token holders so that
they can vote for new tech features and
also certain governor's decisions okay
so our plan is actually we're gonna have
our first delivery by by end of April or
early March yeah that's where we'll have
the asset asset chain which is one of
the chains specializing token issuance
so that we ready and also we will define
the template of what each each chain
will look like what is the placeholder
for smart contract and what is the
placeholder for consensus protocol and
also we're working on the parallel
processing part of the chain of the
feature yeah so by the end of q2 that's
where we're gonna launch the test net of
elf where you can already see Multi
multi chain structure together with
parallel processing capability then
governance model will come later on in
the next quarter and by end of this year
that's where we'll launch the main net
and together with a couple of the apps
that we'll be running on top of that so
it's a very ambitious timeline but our
team has been working on this and we are
constantly coming in to our github and
the good thing is also
so a lot of you know helpers because
these open source project so a lot of
people are also committing their codes
to us of course you know any new
platform does not win just because of
the technology it's important to build
an ecosystem an ecosystem needs capital
the commercial applications and
Technology I mean we're a team that has
been cooperating with many guys so we're
definitely watching the different
technologies in the system in the
industry and for the commercial part we
already started to talk to different
companies startups and corporate we one
of our advisor which I was gonna touch
later on so he's a key tech figure us so
he helps us to introduce startups and to
test out you know new ideas on elf and
also we are working with consulting
companies to have the access to large
corporates so that we can we can see
what are the most viable business models
on blockchain on the capital side we
already got investment from many crypto
funds so we are also working with them
to found new projects that are promising
and can help us to build up the
ecosystem yeah so yeah just quick
introduction so you were about the team
so you already have seen how Bo which is
four sitting over there yeah so the
interesting about him is he entered this
field in 2013 and as a busy person as he
is he tried many things he built up one
of the crypto exchanges in China which
is still running as a CTO he also built
up a payment system which is similar to
upbeat pay in China and that's why
that's where you know so last year I was
speaking to him then we talked about how
important infrastructure is and this
whole idea of
of comes in second guy is myself so I'm
an engineer by training but I got into
business right after graduation so I
worked in Rowland burger which is one of
the leading consultancy especially in
Europe and Asia yeah so I've I stayed in
Southeast Asia for five years so that's
where I worked with governments and
large cooperates all together the
interesting here is I start to see how
some of the emerging markets are more
willing to adopt new technology because
number one they don't have a legacy
issue you know there's nothing and
number two is also they have seen how
Korea how China how India you know by by
leading some certain technology can
really become a major player in the
market and yet so the other two members
are also in the tech team unfortunately
cannot make it here today this is our
advisory board I guess you guys already
seen this this guy
Shoji so Vincent so he was the founder
of FBG capital who was on the stage just
now yeah so he has been very help
very helpful you know imparting his
knowledge into us and you know as a
found they also have a very nice
portfolio of different ICO projects so
that's where we leverage their
connections you know to get you know
hashed also to speak to different
companies to stay you know to stay ahead
of what's going on in the market yeah so
liam is also a one of the founders in
another found more focusing in Europe
it's called alphabet so Kenneth Kenneth
is the senior senior partner of Denton's
which is an international law firm the
reason that you know we need him is
because to navigate in such a complex
industry you know we think we need
strong guidance and help on legal stuff
and he's been very helpful and very
knowledgeable because he also did khyber
also did 10x that's why we're very happy
you know to have him and leverage his
knowledge in that um the last person
Michael Arrington I don't know whether
you have heard about him
no have you heard about TechCrunch so
he's the founder of TechCrunch yeah so
he's been this field for a long time you
know ever since the industry internet
business so we're very good to have him
because you know he helps us to increase
our presence in us which is a very
important market for us in terms of
deaths and also in terms of use cases
yeah so I don't know how many of you
actually heard about elf before this
anyone heard about elf before huh can
you raise your hands thank you yeah not
that many which is also expected the
reason was because we didn't do any
public sale
for our tokens for multiple reasons for
regulatory compliance you know also as a
infrastructure project you know we want
to have a global presence from the very
beginning and also we want to have the
longtime investors you know from from
day one because globalization I think is
also it's really the key thing about
this decentralization because every time
we talk about crypto two things right
it's borderless meaning that even we
don't speak the same language when we
talk about Bitcoin or we talk about
other different technology all of a
sudden people start to talk and it's
24/7 that's why for us the main thing
here is really about globalization yeah
just to highlight some of the investors
we have right now very happy to have
hashed on board I think without them we
cannot make this we can make this meetup
happen and also Korea is really an
important market for us for multiple
reasons you know you have really good
creative people in this market also you
know very willing to a
accept new things and you know the
growth of the crypto industry in Korea
is also true is phenomenal yes we love
to be here yeah from the US side we have
galaxies so that's Michael Novogratz
which also has been investing in a lot
of projects in the past block tower so
that's a repo also very active opinion
key opinion leader on Twitter and has
been blocked in crypto for a long time
we also have some of the most dominant
phones from Southeast Asia the Signum
Capitol yeah so I think we're happy that
we already have a lineup of global
investors so for us the next step is go
global in other aspects so that means
the community that means the dev the dev
groups even for our team so I'm going to
talk about that so we did our private
token sale last December and that was a
very quick one so it has been one month
and let me share with you what we have
done yeah so what you know having a
private sale has a lot of benefits but
it also has one big issue because none
of you have heard about us so that's a
big issue we want people to know about
us to understand our technology so that
we can build helpers we can build you
know community that really helps us on
coding on design on business development
right that's why we have doing a
catch-up gain in the past one month so
we have established different channels
our key channel right now is telegram
and also which a group so within one
month we already have 40,000 members in
our English Channel I still remember on
the first day when we started to do our
channel it gets to from like 500 to all
of sudden to 2,000 and by then we don't
have a community manager team so I was
the one that was Christmas Day actually
so I have to like reply
24/7 I couldn't sleep right but the good
thing here is also something like I
really see the value of crypto is a lot
of volunteers jumped out you know people
who really like our project so they
start to help each other they become the
moderators in the group so that's why
right now with 40,000 members we let the
community to manage themselves and still
we believe that's the best way to do it
and also for Chinese speaking channels
we have 20,000 members right now we have
launched Korean Japanese Arabic and
Russian channels all together because
you know we really want to engage
different cultures and we really respect
that because for myself I have been
studied in different places so I live in
u.s. I live in Singapore I was origin
originally from China spending some time
in Germany so I do see the benefits the
value adding you know having different
values and different views and I think
sometimes the sparks comes out of that
clash okay yeah and also recently we
have engaged with a PR agency of which
is based in New York so it's called
Waxman so they have been running
successfully for many projects including
like Madonna oh yeah so they're very
we're very happy you know so we're
trying to put all the place all the
resources in place so that we can grow
the community it's not just like this
it's not just this because even for
github right now when we release our
codes there are many helpers that also
come commit their codes and helping us
so we see the community as a extended
team for ourselves which also means that
you know we want to engage more with the
community so we have launched a project
it's a bounty program it's called
Azeroth also from Warcraft so what we
want to achieve here is really we want
to have one central
one place where we can have different
tasks that we want the community to
accomplish and to prove the order to you
know to reward the work we also give
tokens out so one interesting finally we
see this as an experiment so this has
been running for one week or so so if
you see the color that's how the
distribution of participants for
community actually we see it's pretty
global except unfortunately we're not in
a green that's Iceland I think yeah it's
good Greenland yeah we're not in
Greenland but pretty much we have a very
nice coverage and within one week we
received you know over seventy thousand
users in this program and that comes
from almost 6000 cities
and we have made this specifically also
for Korea so we have translated the
website and we encourage people to try
it out so right now it's more of a
social media influence based tasks you
know reading our Twitter letting people
know about us later on we have more
tasks which will be more focused on you
know understanding a project or you know
helping us on certain tasks I encourage
you guys to definitely try it out yeah
in terms of exchanges we already listed
on quite a few exchanges in case you
guys want you know what I want to check
it out so we're already on our BitFenix
and also finance on my other guys I mean
also I think this is thanks to our our
preparation for the legal side so that
we can be cleared out quite fast okay
yeah and the last part is yeah we keep
on talking about community right and we
don't want to be South Korea and just
like we do we want the community to to
ban to to help us and also help us to
manage the community here that's why for
Korea we definitely want dedicated
persons who help us to run the community
and marketing and if there are any
depths that are interested in us you
know besides just help us on github you
can also approach us you can be part of
a team this is the same plan that we're
going to do in Silicon Valley or in
Berlin or any other countries you know
where we see that a strong interest that
comes out of it so it goes back to my to
our NGO you know we want to be global
and we want to be open and this is only
the first step that we're reaching that
goal and very happy to share that with
you guys
I think that's believe that's oh yeah
right thank you very much
[Applause]
yep
[Music]
as tribe using the Chinese I own page
okay and it requires the reputation code
yeah right yeah we can we can talk about
it later I can do that no problem for
that
yeah but thank you for testing it out
yeah
I'm sure you've been asked this question
ever since what do you think yeah so I
think that goes back to the slide why I
talk about United Nation and Federation
because what poco does is to United
heterogeneous chains we need each chain
actually oh oh it's from a different
technology and it's from a different
community right because Polk door is
basically trying to link a theorem with
it's a Bitcoin then also with Alf with
someone else but each of them actually
has a very distinctive community and
culture that's why they're trying to
achieve yeah for elf what we're doing
here is to link homogeneous chains
because every chain is actually using
the same of kernel that the same
template yeah so they're not that much
different they start from the same base
then we allow customization on top of
that but you know the roots are still
the same and also for elf them the
biggest innovation is actually not the
cross chain communication it's more
about how to making sure the cloud
computing feature really works because
that's not something that we have seen
in the market yet that's where we need
to do the task scheduler right and you
sure the efficiency and security yes I
hope that answer your question
okay that's a very good question
you know people and it's all the
transaction was accused in side by side
Petrelli offseason we with have metadata
for every transaction you can make a
transfer money to be and Silicon Valley
transform varsity so to chat section
words not not to each other so we tended
to tribute these transactions into two
portions and true
to increase performance under you do
Bitcoin and and etern would run on any
computer
ISM is a servant client
so the question is services is word
community but the performance is only
one is it because your PC came from
Israel time but if we consider
approaching system as a database only
the banking law has alleged that the
beta and the mining law is not only one
computer not assume so living our system
considers the PQ apps and a smooth
clusters so the performance can be
increased by having machines children
and crossroads and let the community for
some problem when we use YouTube will
use only one website but behind it it
has a big base it has King jobs of
system can control ethics questions
frankly speaking I have no idea but
myself but one of my friends have a
great interest in sorry okay how about
the current Chinese government
regulation toward procedure its first
even second is what is the elf's to main
events advantages compared to the
forward the combinational angelica yeah
so for the first one I think every
country not just China everyone is very
protective of their investors I think
that's what needs to be done also us
today just had the same hearing and
meeting today but I think the takeaway
here is always about protections
regulations has to be in place to put
the financing is correct
I think hundred percent okay but all the
countries are actually also saying that
blockchain has its potential in the
future so he all goes down to the
fundamental technology which is exactly
what we're trying to do we're trying to
prove here so for us by working on the
tech the technical platform I don't see
any issues with the government's which
actually has been promoted by many
countries right now right I think us
today I haven't read the news by what I
heard is the government is also
basically saying do not harm this
emerging technology yeah I hope that
answer your question so the other part
yes so combining poke dot plus silica or
or combining polka dot of us maybe it
will make it very similar to elf in that
case yeah but it's not there yet so
we're trying to be the first one to
introduce that that
just from a architecture point of view
you know having high-performance chain
but multiple ones talking to each other
and the key but but the other innovation
is the cloud computing capability that
we talked about just now having the
ability to execute transactions in
parallel so that's something that has we
have not seen yet so I think that will
be the key differentiator between us and
the other chains
Matt Savelle very stationary monitor oh
thank you very much for your okay
yeah just one last sentence sorry up so
back to the central and you know so over
also for us for this one interacting we
were all very open you know to work
across the industry because the industry
started very small but now we're getting
more more interesting people
that's why transparency openness
collaboration also always plays a part
that's why at the very beginning when
when the central and started the auction
of the lands we actually work together
to launch a crypto Valley so it's a
virtual place for the different ICO
projects or crypto projects you know to
have their presence and we're quite
pleased you know see actually a lot of
projects have take part in that yeah so
just want to know share this so that you
guys can check it out all right okay
thank you
[Applause]
[Applause]
alright Joe Sam Levine
welcome to hashed interview thank you
it's my pleasure having you here so I'm
going to ask you about some some cashews
blah blah chain and cryptocurrency it's
a truck sounds good alright so I want to
start with the question regarding your
speech today so in a keynote you
presented kind of a new concept of idea
DTP is I think it's quite interesting so
can you tell us more about that
Oh glad you're interested that that's
great so DT PS decentralized
transactions per second is an idea that
a bunch of us at consensus have been
talking about for a little while the
idea there is that measuring
transactions per second is both
subjective and kind of meaningless in
the blockchain ecosystem so we can have
many transactions per second in a in a
sequel database and that's great well we
can have many transactions per second in
a slightly decentralized blockchain
system that's nice but I think one of
the main goals for the blockchain
ecosystem is to get to trust to to
create a revolution in trust to build a
a much better foundational trust layer
for all of the things we build in
society and so we should start thinking
about how to measure decentralization
and there some efforts already are we
decentralized yet calm etc and once we
have pretty good notions of the
different dimensions of decentralization
then we can start comparing what a
transaction looks like in aetherium
versus what it looks like in less
decentralized system perhaps and and so
first of all transactions can be very
different over different systems you can
have a very heavy transaction on one
system a very light transaction on
another system and everybody just
measures transactions per se
and so that's difficult to you know
match those things up and and derive
meaning from that but most importantly
certain platforms are very decentralized
maximally decentralized at theorem in
Bitcoin are the two most decentralized
yet still they're not as decentralized
as they could be and will be hopefully
over time and so we should put a number
on that and a number on different
platforms that claim they're the most
decentralized platform in the world and
and compare them and so the idea is that
we will put up a website and we will
invite the world to come and help us
define the different mess the different
dimensions of decentralization so in an
ecosystem you could have some dimensions
essentially what the foundation
governance looks like how many
developers there are how many different
clients there are that may factor in but
it wouldn't be as core as how many
different nodes there are on a platform
what the consensus algorithm is how many
different owners or controllers there
are for all the nodes and even subtle
things like are all these nodes sitting
in the same power grid so are a million
nodes in a us-based power grid a single
usb-based power grid more decentralized
if they're owned by a million people
then say five nodes that are in
different power grids owned by five
different people around the world and so
we're trying to source some information
on that website will be released in a
little while and source the different
names of the dimensions and what those
dimensions mean and then we'll try to
put together objective statements on how
to to put these measures together so the
idea is you take a well-defined
transaction for a second number and then
a decentralized quotient and then you
take the product of that so if we have a
standard transaction we figure out how
many of those run on aetherium
and if we have a decentralized quotient
of say zero point seven out of one zero
to 1 for the etherium Network then that
would be the DT PS would be the quotient
times the number of transactions per
second right right so I think that like
in T psy is it's more clear I mean clear
but in terms of like DQ decentralization
question there could be some controversy
very much contrary so I think that'll be
crazy the DQ Wars where everybody's
gonna be fighting over what the
different dimensions are and what the
different definitions of the different
dimensions the whole point is to bring
in lots of people with different
opinions and start talking about this
stuff right so the easier numbers
numbers you showed in their keynote see
that we just made those up so I I tried
to say in the keynote that these are
hand wavy arguments these are not based
on on any real data right or not even
very much thinking it was just one of
the first presentations of the idea and
it's just a sketch really very so so you
although you said that Bitcoin and III
has more room for like more
decentralization absolutely what a that
be well the the biggest most obvious one
is when a theorem moves from proof of
work to proof of stake as a consensus
algorithm right it will likely get much
more decentralized it'll get much more
scalable and it'll get much more secure
because it's a better outcome but
because people won't have to buy
expensive hardware because people won't
have to pay a huge amount for
electricity and because efficiencies of
scale won't apply in proof of stake so
you want it there won't be any advantage
to having a whole bunch of phones or
little devices running proof of stake
notes in a warehouse you running them on
your laptop and me running on my phone
across
across the world would be just as
efficient in that sort of situation with
the barriers to entry very low anybody
can run a validator on their laptop
maybe on their their iPad or phone it at
some point soon and so we think that's
gonna bring many more people into the
ecosystem you'll be able to to stake 32
ether if you want to do it directly or
they're different pools well where
you'll be able to stake less than 32
ether and participate in validation of
transactions and and secure the theorem
network so when Casper proof of state
comes online and it'll so a theorem 2.0
is coming out and say 12 to 18 months
and the first phase of that phase 0
should be there there 8 different teams
and they should be in sync on a test
network within a small handful of months
maybe it's four months from that and so
we can very soon will start to be able
to run Casper great proof of stake it
won't be a real blockchain system yet
but we can start to to see how that
system works and there will be real
value tokens on that network so I
imagine that when a theorem 2.0 comes
out it will be by far the most
decentralized platform on the planet
very cool
so concept of dtpa is interesting but at
the same time I think that it's
interesting you brought up other like
smart contract platforms in the same
like comparison so like back in 2017
like it's my contract platform assuming
was the almost the only one right but
now there are like many so how do you
see like are they useful do you think or
do you think you can recommend I think
it's great I think it's validation it
means this is a good idea and when human
beings see a good idea many of them rush
in and they try to create variations on
that idea or better ideas and some of
them just try to monetize different
variations of that good idea the
technology blockchain technology
decentral
protocol technology is still very
immature and so we need many different
projects around the world to explore the
solution space right so it's great
there's some really good projects out
there there are very many not very good
projects out there whatever happens it's
pretty clear to almost everybody that
aetherium
will be if not the absolute dominant
platform one of the most important
platforms for for quite a long time it's
by far the biggest ecosystem and it's
moving faster than any other ecosystem
it's bringing on a huge amount of
scalability right now in terms of
decentralized transactions for a second
so I think by the end of this year we'll
have hundreds of thousands or millions
of decentralized transactions per second
using layer 2 technologies with state
channels or ZK star Gansey case dark
mechanisms and plasma chains and etc so
theorems doing well it will hopefully
share some of its technology with other
projects but also learn from some other
projects the etherion project has never
been bashful about taking good ideas
from elsewhere and trying to incorporate
it into our systems and that's the
beauty of open source and it's very the
blockchain space is competitive but it's
also pretty warm and collaborative the
etherium ecosystem is very warm and
collaborative but we all see each other
at conferences all the time and people
except for a few projects people are
really quite open about about what
they're doing all right so this clear my
tricky question but I will try so there
will be like developer audience
audiences for hashed interview so if you
have to recommend smart contract
platform and if there they don't like
Israel as of now because of TPS over
confirmation time then region would you
recommend for them I would recommend a
layer to technology to that it's linked
in
to the base trust layer of a theorem so
if you're building a game for instance
you can use the loom technology a game
company called axia infinity is bringing
their own scalability technology so
there
y-ye choose an inferior system when you
can get all the scalability you want in
a less decentralized blockchain system
but then if you link it in to a theorem
with plasma you get pretty much the full
security of the theorem network if
anything goes wrong on that game
platform the game developers or the
publishers are trying to steal your
digitally scarce sword and you know sell
it or use it in in some other game they
can't do that essentially plasma enables
you to checkpoint the state of all those
systems on etherium on layer 1 and they
won't be able to steal our digital
assets because they're easy to pull back
to it they're right talking about gaming
so rehashed believe that like blockchain
based gaming is the we'll kick off the
mass adoption of blockchain so so that's
why we launched our hostile apps program
to support the app developers and gaming
game developers so what do you think of
blockchain gaming like what do you
expect I agree with your thesis that
it's such a good fit that game
publishers for so long have essentially
owned the digital asset right and there
have been lots of skins markets so it's
probably a multi-billion dollar economy
we should you know on a theorem there's
a standard composite token standard and
there's another standard that enables
you to move essentially non fungible
tokens between different game platforms
so I think that's going to drive a bit
of a rebel
in gaming you can have in-game economies
with real assets and I think it's just a
match made in heaven
mm-hmm all right so the end of the last
year
lots of people actually talked about
consensus on its reorganization right so
and you call it like many times
consensus 2.0 so can you do you want to
talk about it on what was the consensus
2.0 and how is this going so consensus
has reorganized itself many times since
it was essentially one person or two
people in in 2014 we noticed 18 months
ago or two years ago that hey there's a
real ecosystem it's growing really
quickly many different organizations
from big four accounting companies to
IBM to many others are essentially
rushing into the space and and looking
how to compete in a next-generation
IT technology so similar to the database
wars and the operating system wars in
the browser wars and mobile wars and the
game platform wars the blockchain wars
are I think happening and maybe we'll
call them the blockchain collaborations
rather than wars but there are so many
opportunities now and 18 months ago
consensus started to organize itself to
be more commercial rather than just
doing cool things and we built a lot of
successful pieces we consider them
building blocks or core components and
we're able to package them up now to
offer a future of work suite or a core
tech stack or a FinTech defy a set of
tools doing work in media entertainment
journalism
advertising technology supply chain so
it's really about getting more
commercial right so to be more
commercial like if you select just one
industry or one sector what would be the
biggest focus of consensus this year so
we do quite a bit of work in a few
different industries so we do work in
FinTech Financial Services and
increasingly in decentralized finance we
work with banks and central banks and we
have for quite a long time do a lot of
supply chain work so our violent project
has worked with works with organizations
like GlaxoSmithKline and an energy super
major and a major American consumer
products company World Food Program so
lots of activity on that front doing
work with a a very large luxury brand in
Europe and we're in many Nicias we're in
the energy niche we're trying to spin up
a game studio there's a work we're not
very advanced on that front but pretty
excited about as you are about the
possibilities there right right
alright so I and of course so that when
you talk about different Nicias I
immediately think enterprise but we also
do the bulk of our work in the public
blockchain space so that that's projects
like meta mask which is evolving it's
it's about to release an incredibly cool
mobile version of the client it's in
fira it's you port it's three box its
collide o which is a blockchain as a
service platform for a theorem that has
about 2,000 consortium on it right now
we're really excited about the Pantheon
client our Pegasus group is so we have
about 85 protocol engineers at consensus
and the bulk of them are in our Pegasus
group protocol engineering insist
group and we have what we believe is the
best client on the planet for a theorem
it's microservices architecture it's
Java and it's Apache - which means that
it's very easy for companies to adopt it
it conforms to the enterprise a theorem
Alliance enterprise standard and most of
the other clients have either licensing
issues or other issues that make it less
interesting for companies to adopt it
all right so it looks like consensus is
working with many like companies and
like resisting for example like central
bank like I think that it would be not
that easy to work with
like existing big companies were a
central bank
especially when you pursue
decentralization like is there any
friction or nope nope zero so blockchain
is a next-generation database technology
right now that enables us to build more
trustworthy systems the trust
characteristic comes from
decentralization it doesn't have to be
as maximally decentralized as pblica
theorem in order to get benefit of
increased trust in your system and so
we've done work with the Monetary
Authority of Singapore South African
Reserve Bank South African Reserve Bank
wanted to build a real-time gross
settlement system that would link all of
its member banks so that if something
happened and the South African Reserve
Bank computers were offline the network
still kept working right right so we can
just take advantage of blockchain we're
like remove vector of decentralization
lots of companies are interested in some
decentralization right in their internal
systems and many consortium are very
interested in decentralization because
they can work they can collaborate with
the different companies in their space
or the companies in their value chain
like a supply chain and nobody has to
own the machines nobody has to own the
software everybody can essentially share
ownership share intellectual property
and just makes it easier to
build collaborative systems where before
it was much more difficult before
blockchain I think it's very practical
but like for some decentralization
idealist they think that it should be I
mean something should be fully
decentralized I mean decentralize it
application or blockchain governance and
to do that they think that decentralized
autonomous organization like Tao
conserve is really important sure so but
what you're decentralized organizations
are very important so again we look at
each different use case and build the
appropriate architecture for each use
case not every use case needs a
blockchain not every use case needs any
decentralization some use cases I think
we'll need the maximal decentralization
of the etherium platform if you've got a
token that it's very valuable there are
well resourced entities around the world
that are patient in are good at finding
flaws and systems and if system is not
sufficiently decentralized and it will
have vulnerabilities that they can take
advantage right decentralized
organizations I prefer to call them do s
reven d AOS early on people started
calling them dows but they're not
autonomous really at least the ones that
we built are not autonomous all the
decentralized organizations that we
built have people in governance all
right if we build a decentralized
organization and its you know
sufficiently well architected so that it
can run itself without governance by
people you sort of snip the strings and
then maybe it offers a service to people
as customers but no people actually
control that so I would call that a
decentralized autonomous organization so
I want to ask you about tokens so token
is like essential essential instrument
to make
now or deal right sure so any any
protocol-based open platform if you're
trying to incentivize people to share
their resources or to participate
collaboratively on a platform in
different roles you usually have to send
incentivize them in some way and and
tokens are very ideal very focused
mechanism to bring people to these
protocol-based open platforms so they
can be a base level one like a theorem
or Bitcoin or they can be something a
protocol based open platform built on a
theorem like the huge-o music platform
or the civil journalism platform where
people own tokens in order to stake
their newsrooms on the civil platform
and pledge that they will be ethical
because it's a platform for sustainable
and ethical journalism people can also
use tokens to reward the journalists or
to try to revise try to improve the
Constitution that all the journalists
are adherent to right but even if the
token is useful you know last year
actually there was a big challenge about
tokens value capture mechanism right so
what do you think I think we need to
build good software that people find
compelling and want to use and then the
token value capture will take care of
itself
so it's not about value capture in
tokens it's about building good software
that that people will care of it so you
think that like problem is value
creation that value capture right that's
also all right that's interesting
so like for example like Bitcoin like
medium of exchange or like store value
so do you think that still this kind of
mechanism can capture the value from the
network it helps capture lots about your
husband mm-hm
it has but the followers like I mean
same model same design but failed
sure well systems have network effects
and liquidity if there aren't if there
are two identical systems and I find
about them at exactly find out about
them at exactly the same time and this
one has 99% of the people and this one
has 1% of the people this is going to be
less valuable it'll have less liquidity
or much less interested in it so add to
that the fact that this one started much
earlier and you have a winner in the
Bitcoin space anyway so many people
actually because many people
disappointed in like tokens value or
price maybe now people are very
skeptical like about token sales mm-hmm
so what do you think I think people
should build better software all right
and sell a token that makes a lot of
sense on that open platform and nobody
will be disappointed in that I mean lots
of people were disappointed with the
user experience of the Internet in 1992
or the web in 1993 and 1997 and software
developers kept building better and
better things and 20 years later Society
has been profoundly transformed so you
are still very often - a token solution
only if the software is valuable right
yes all right I don't build terrible
software and tokenize it all right so we
refine our question so do you have
anything you want to share to our
audience or especially potential DF
developers mmm anything I would say
would be very biased actually an
unbiased thing to say would be learn the
technology build what you want to build
do something that you're passionate
about we are at the start of
maybe one of the most epic revolutions
in human history where essentially the
automated trust age is upon us and there
will be so much to do and so much value
to create alright that's about it thanks
for your time thank you
yeah and great interview
all right so are we gonna wait for your
beer no we're just gonna go okay so
we're gonna keep it pretty casual Mike
no regrets thank you for coming to Korea
right I think it's your first time in
Korea so before we dive too deeply in
can you give us some background so not
my first time in Korea I was first I was
here in 1992 for my bachelor party I
need a well that's her partner you need
that so some of you guys weren't even
born then and then I I came back a lot I
was a major currency trader when I was
in Goldman Sachs and I traded a lot of
Korean Won right through the financial
crises in 97 and that at fortress at one
point I was I think the largest cost B
trader in the world I would stay up at
night every night because it was perfect
hours 12-hour difference and I wouldn't
buy and sell kospi like I'd like a
almost like an addict you know buy sell
buy sell and so between kospi in the one
I have a lot of and I was here five
years ago I gave a speech with the
finance minister and he was
spectacularly I forgot his name whoever
was the finance minister five years ago
was spectacularly talented very smart a
nuanced speech really on the history of
the later the future the labor market in
Korea and I was like man we we need more
of those guys in public service but
that's the last time I was in Korea five
years ago but this is the first time
I've ever seen the blockchain and in
crypto phenomena that is Korea so it's
been pretty exciting super cool to me
coming back though like how did you
first get into kind of Bitcoin and
cryptocurrencies so as a macro trader I
was working at fortress and I got a
phone call from my partner who was a
complete non-technical
Luddite he he was a distressed debt
investor he used to say he was the
world's best garbage man and he had
moved his family in our business part of
our business to San Francisco because
his wife lived there and she told him
she had a stay near getting longer she
divorced him
I think he should have gotten divorced
but he moved his whole family at the San
Francisco that was a joke
and in his YPO group that he joined
there was a guy named winces casa writes
YPO is young presents so he joined this
group and one of the members was a guy
named winces Casa race and whence this
is probably responsible for getting more
people into Bitcoin than anybody else he
has a company called Zappo which is a
custody company in which we were in day
one investors are and so when sis was
telling about this and Pete called me up
and said can you look into Bitcoin in
and macro guys are very fast and I
googled and I started thinking about
this and it had lots of things that
would be a perfect speculative asset it
was a really cool new technology in
cryptography at that point it was about
2012 and we were right in the middle of
the European financial crises and so
we'd had the US financial crisis the
global financial crisis in o8 and now in
the European financial crises in all the
central banks for cutting interest rates
to zero and people thought that was
crazy it was gonna hyper inflate the
world away really smart people thought
it was gonna help create hyperinflation
not just crazy people and I thought we
have people that don't trust central
banks we have the cypherpunks that don't
trust anyone anyway that are you have
libertarians that love this the guys
that want to live off the grid and most
importantly the Chinese had started
buying and I was like this is a perfect
speculative bubble and so we bought a
bunch and and this is before a galaxy
this what I was at fortress this is 2012
Bitcoin was trading about 95 dollars and
we decided as a company not to do it as
a company we do it individually and not
to talk about it and because I have a
big mouth I was at a I was at a small
conference
and somebody had asked me about frontier
currencies they were asking about like
the African currencies or Vietnam dawn
and I said screw those frontier
currencies if you want the real frontier
currency you should buy Bitcoin for
these four reasons one two three four
and you know what it's gonna go from a
hundred to a thousand and the next day I
was in the cover of the FT the next day
fortress novigrad says big claim to go
to a thousand and ever since then I've
been like the Forrest Gump a Bitcoin do
people call me and ask me what I think
and to be fair it went from one hundred
to a thousand and we had bought a lot of
weight and we were rich guys already and
so you know we bought not even one
percent of our net worth but it was
still a lot notionally and so when it
went up it was a whole lot of money and
then of course you don't back down but
that's how I got started one of the
things I think is important is whatever
you buy something and you start making
money you pay a lot more attention and
when you're forced to get on stage and
speak you know so I got invited to
Oxford to speak at Oxford and that was
pretty cool Oxford it's the oldest
debating society in the world and so
then he like ship had better understand
how this works so I was like reading
papers and i'venever Marc Andreessen had
made a speech and I kind of hacked his
speech a little bit I didn't feel bad
cuz he had hacked his speech from a
Stanford professor woman named Susan
hatha but that's how I started getting
into it okay where did you go from there
I mean did you beat those there's some
time between forces and yells ye so if
you remember Bitcoin went up went back
down the road and then it kind of went
to 200 and it stayed there dead for
about eighteen months the dead died and
luckily I had other stuff to do so I
wasn't only paying attention we had
funded a company called Pantera dan
Morehead was a college friend and I had
funded his hedge fund once before so I
called him I said look into
and two weeks later to his credit he
called back and said this is gonna
change the world
and one of the reasons Pete and I bought
as much Bitcoin as we did is because Dan
was buying it for us in the unit well
how much you buying
he said I'm buying this much I gotta buy
at least as much as him because we're a
lot richer it's we didn't want to be
embarrassed and so we probably bought
three to four times more than we would
have just because more had lot so much
and so the three of us remember a
partnership and so anyways when I when
it went dead Dan was working on this
company we weren't paying attention and
I left fortress at the end of 2015
yeah no no member of 2015 and you know
after brushing off the dirt and glass I
said I better look at my portfolio
now I don't have a job ice my wife
spends a lot of money how am I gonna pay
for this big lifestyle give money to
charity and I got very nervous I was
like cancel the flowers and I had a
friend another classmate named Joe Lubin
who runs a company called consensus he's
from 15 as well he's Princeton 87 as
well me Morehead in luminar all
classmates Wow yeah and Joe is my
roommate yeah yes my roommate and you
know Jose Annan said that his story is
an interesting story as is but when I
had gone on TV to talk about Bitcoin
I got a Facebook message from Mosholu
but I hadn't seen him in like 18 months
and he was in Barbados with this
beautiful girl who was a signet and he
was coding on the etherion project and
he was telling me but for more Bitcoin
is good but there's gonna be something
that's great called a theorem this was
before 3:00 meeting existed I was like
yeah yeah
and so when I left fortress I thought
who knows more about this stuff than Joe
Lubin so I called off but he moved to
Brooklyn and I went there and I thought
I'll find Joe it'll probably him a dog
the computer and you know maybe a cat
and I walked in and there was 25 people
smart young computer guys older guys
that have been derivative salesmen
employers and they had TVs and there
were people in Israel and Argentina that
were calling in
how did Joe Reuben do this he had never
really had a business he had always been
kind of a drifter one job another job
always very smart no he's very nice a
great friend but had never really been
you know a business guy and now he had
this and beehad a lot like the hashed
office good energy lots of people
walking around not nearly as nice it was
kind of a of a bit of a very
funny neighborhood I'm like oh this
building looks like it's gonna fall down
and there's still their consensus the
same building they they like it and so I
looked and I was like there's something
more to this this is not just a
financial speculation this is a
revolution and it's a revolution of
people that feel like the world was
unfair that there's a better way to set
things up this decentralized version of
the world the web 3.0 could be a lot
better than we have 2.0 and they were
plotting this revolution and so I
immediately said to Joe hey what does it
cost you to run this business and he
told me what it cost him to run this
business and I said well if I give you
ten million dollars rich you know I'll
buy a piece of your business
and Joe said well that's a great idea
and I'll have to be very interesting and
I said well can you write what your
business is on a piece of paper so the
real purist in this world the
decentralized ownership decentralized
everything distributed trust distributor
so he started writing down and he to be
honest he said you know this is a new
company it's gonna take me about a month
I always think a CEO should be able to
write down their business write on a one
piece of paper really simple because
it's not as simple as that you know I
own a piece of this and this guy owns
this and you know they're already
setting up he really believes in the
decentralized world and so their company
runs decentralized and I was lucky
enough to have been a macro trader my
whole life and you always learn this
lesson if you have this idea that
something's gonna work and you say ok
I'll fly to Indonesia to do due
diligence on the Indonesian Rupiah by
the time you go there and do all the due
diligence the damn things already moved
and so I thought when you smell it when
it feels right buy something because if
you have to pay a higher price than you
at least have the low price and so I
said I'm not leaving until I buy some
etherium and Joe wasn't gonna sell me
his etherium he was holding on he's like
I've worked too hard I'm keeping mine
and in New York it wasn't legal if you
didn't have a bit license to buy or sell
theremin the only legal exchange was
Gemini and they weren't doing it there
yet so I was like and the guys they were
just set up an account in New Jersey and
I learned if you're a rich guy you don't
break the rules right it sounds like but
I could buy OTC and so I ended up
calling metallic-y admit once didn't
really know me and I bought aetherium
from Italian you OTC dthe from Batali
and 96 cents I'm not gonna tell you how
much but it's not an insignificant yeah
and then I sort of blind more OTC in the
market and so now I owned a lot of
aetherium at call it a dollar 50 a lot
and you know I went away to India I came
back
it was trading it they had two weeks
later try to get five or six it started
going I mean this is down March and I
realized Joe no longer needed my money
because he owned a lot of a theory of
memory and you know you don't want to
arbitrage your friend and I was thinking
how would I contributed we have a very
similar well he has a much more
technical skill set than me but he's a
good leader he's a good speaker and so I
said I'm gonna just cheer for him and
I'm just gonna be a private investor and
I hired a young kid and got him John
West who was great and he actually
pretty much lived that the consensus
office so you can go live with those
guys and so it was fun to get a
bird's-eye view of the beginning even
the Dow hack we I was on the conference
calls listening as the only wise guy
just thinking and trading I just have
trading in my blood and so I'd buy and
sell and ether with the twenty nine sold
a bunch and bought it back at eight and
it wasn't until but a year later
what about April ether I was forty
whatever they started to move that I
started thinking about doing a beer
business and just being an investor and
that was for a couple reasons I had one
conversation actually with a brilliant
guy and he was telling me but he had
these investors of these investors and I
was like we him I got jealous I was like
wait a minute I I know all those guys I
should get those and so that got me
going and then I did an interview Joe
had asked me do you favor will you come
be on a panel he's always done me lots
of favors I'll do him a favor
and on the panel again the same thing
happening I didn't know the press was
there and I said I have 20% of my net
worth and that went on from Nigeria to
Japan to all over it it's all we do
pedia it got picked up all over the
place and I was like oh so now everyone
I was doing crypto and and then Bluebird
gasping in our
you and Eric shocker and I did this like
40 minute interview and it got watched
by thousands and thousands of people and
I started thinking this is such an
interesting space and I'm 52 I have
another chapter or two left in life you
know being a private minister is fun but
it's not you're not in the middle of
something and so to be in the middle of
something is is really rewarding if you
have to think you said something to
offer and you can't do it as a family
office you can't hire you can hire one
or two more people you can't hire an
army but you tired army you've got to
make them feel like it's their company
and so we had this idea that we'd build
a company and my brother named a galaxy
because we love Star Wars yeah well any
of anything Star Wars goes well but also
we wanted to be in the center
you know this exploding center of this
new world and since then we've been
running not as fast as this guy but
right very fast hiring you know
investing and talking a lot about I talk
so much I sometimes get bored of hearing
myself no this is I didn't know any of
this background story this is actually
really good
now can you what if what about
explaining galaxy in a nutshell so we're
trying to build a merchant bank or an
investment bank and so the primary
purpose of an investment bank is to
raise capital for other people we want
to be the credential Iser and so if it's
a big company that needs to raise two
hundred million or an ICO or an SEO we
want to be the bank that you know that's
them that helps them to structure the
reveal and then helps them place it I
think in order to raise money certainly
if you have money you better be willing
to invest and so side by side with the
investment banking arm is a direct
investment our our best business so far
is Direct Investing because we've been
doing it a long time and so that's an
infrastructure plays and wallets and
custody in icos in protocol and abs and
in funds if we think we should sponsor a
fun so we have a big broad portfolio and
we're building a banking
I used to be such an active trader that
I was one of the biggest customers for I
remember I was circles largest customer
and I said wait a but why do I paying
all the bid espera and so we're building
an OTC trading business in an electronic
trading business to compete with
cumberland and circle and octagon and
all those guys and then we've got an
asset management business which is
really only gonna be for things that are
very scalable that we don't want to put
on our balance sheet and so like a bit
me of a beta product with bloomberg
which is a bloomberg galaxy crypto index
which is the 10 biggest coins
captain 30% rebalance monthly it's a
wonderful index product mostly because
bloomberg is doing it
Bloomberg has 300 people in their index
group they are wildly professional and
so they scrape the data they make sure
the prices are real they print the the
index um it was our name and we help the
consult but they do all the work and
that's good because people then trust
we're not so for coin Bates to have its
own index it's like wait a minute you're
telling them you're setting you the
prices on your own index that doesn't
really fly institutionally and so those
are the four businesses two of them are
strong because we've been doing it for a
long time our investment in business and
our proprietary trading cell coins buy
coins sell coins buy coins and the rest
of them are works in progress building
businesses is hard that takes time
you gotta get the regulatory framework
right you got to hire the right people
and so but we're pretty excited we have
four for business principles which I
think are interesting one is be invested
this is a secular bull market and so
being invest I think is important to is
be diversified big-play Maximus and the
wrong way to think about this I tell
this story in 1999 about a month before
the collapse my mother called me up and
I
a middle-class kid now I had become a
partner of Goldman Sachs I was very
proud of myself and she was like all my
neighbors bought Amazon I don't know in
the Amazon she was like how could you be
so stupid you didn't tell me to buy
Amazon I was like her neighbors bought
like $100 of a massage or as a mom and
anyway of course the market crashed it
was in my head though and I said you
know what I'm not gonna miss the Chinese
internet and I had a friend who brought
me a guy he was a white guy with very
thick glasses and he had a company
called made for China calm and I gave
him almost all my liquidity I was like
this is my Chinese Internet but if it
works I'm gonna be rich and of course it
went to zero and I look back if I had
just made 10 bets Baidu
a leave of I think there were not that I
worked at Goldman Sachs they saw
everything I would have just done so
much better
I threw the dart at the only zero on the
board you know and so when I started
crypt I was like we're not gonna be so
arrogant I think we know what blockchain
is gonna want to diversify be
diversified third be in the center be in
the center for lots of reasons so you
see all that ideal flow and you get to
get in at a good price
so you see the information flow this
business more than almost any helps to
be in the center why I flew to Korea
it's a long flight is I met this guy he
seems to be in the center out here and I
said okay if we can piggyback off his
connection all understand this business
much quicker we're doing the same all
over the world so be in the center and
the last piece is a little different
than most people is be disciplined what
do you mean discipline the laws of
markets didn't change just because it's
crypto you know and so a lot of people
this is a whole new no it's market still
and so when things get the stupid prices
we sell them and I don't regret it you
know when we realize we're in a crummy
investment we get out of it and so use
the same trading rules that I've
whole life to keep the the portfolio
management moving in the right direction
and so like this idea of hotle you know
there are some investments that you
wanna make the you're whole' for a long
period of time and there others it makes
no sense dawdle if some protocol or gap
starts trading at a stupid valuation
where you're never gonna be able to grow
into it sell it or get shortens and so
you know when x RP traded to three
dollars and 20 cents i looked at they
have 60 billion coins on their balance
sheet 60 billion times 3 a hundred
eighty billion dollars it made them the
seventh biggest company in the world or
tenth biggest company in the world with
and I was like that's really stupid and
I actually said that on Twitter and I
sold a lot of XRP short and he shorted
it short of it I like the company
I own a very big chunk of ripple equity
but but the but the the token got to a
stupid price you know why--i that's the
Korean market yes because the Koreans
were all buying it one of the reasons
the regulators in the United States in
Japan and in Korea got involved is
because you had a lot of new players to
markets that didn't really understand
what they were doing they didn't
understand be disciplined that the law
of gravity works and so regulators are
there to protect the little guy so my
joke fell flat and I think they're doing
a good job of kind of resetting the rule
and you will see what comes out of it
but I don't think we'll see another year
like 2017 where things go with that and
same
I do think once institutions start
buying you'll see the same phenomena of
a FOMA institutions will have the same
fear of missing out that retail did but
the infrastructure around
the space will be the the regulate the
regular regulation will be more mature
the risk management systems will be
moment share with evaluation metrics
no one even understood how tokens worked
I bought some IC ozan embarrassingly
enough I didn't even understand the
token I know someone told me something
and it turned out not to be the right
one
and so I think it's very important I
don't really understand token economics
how it works and to use your your
business men's head forget crypto just
business but hey does that make any
sense and so I'm very bullish on right
the maturity of the the industry so
we're running out of time I have one
kind of final question that anyone
always asks right you mentioned I think
Bitcoin going to 50k end of the era are
you still bullish I can say 50k so I
what I said is we're gonna have a hard
time taking out 10k until we get an
institutional positive solution and if
we get an institutional custody solution
and what I mean by that is a name that
institutional investors trust it's
Goldman Sachs or State Street or
Sumitomo Bank or Hong Kong Shanghai Bank
something that they trust then I think
we can we can retest the highs until
then I think yes I think we put in the
lows for the year yeah but I don't see
an explosion up because there's no new
buyers right retail got hurt I do think
Japan is gonna turn back on in about two
months and so you'll see some excitement
there and we'll push the price up but
there's a lot of bad Long's
trapped above 10,000 so you're gonna go
to 10,000 it's gonna hit a ceiling like
and come back to have and so you really
need the institutions to take that next
leg but I think within 12 months we'll
have that enrolled will will retest that
20,000 high and then when you break that
then that's that's when the
institution's come and then it's a whole
new game can you comment on any other
coin and or tokens that you were quite
bullish on
sure I like yes token I think the you
know the the blockchain just started
uneo so it's about a month old
blockchains our governments you know
their constitutions and lots of ways and
you know it wasn't perfect when it
started and there's changes being made
and I think over the next few months
you'll see that community settle into
something that feels right and vibrant
and it's gonna operate much faster than
all the rest of the block chains and so
part of the thesis there is some portion
of the community is going to choose
convenience over the purists you know
really more nodes right cos has a
delegator proof of state model where
they have 20 nodes etherium when it
moves to proof of stake is gonna have
you tell me how many nodes lots and so I
think he oasiz is a very interesting one
and on the dap thing i've talked about
this before we have a big bet on wax
it's the intersection between gamey and
crypto there are 90 times more gamers
than there are crypto people and so it's
also a really interesting on-ramp for
gamers to be able to buy into crypto so
it should be synergistic both ways I
like that I like the whole idea of
gaming in crypto I'm looking for more
ideas in that space we have a big what
we have a bet on a project called cosmos
which will be it's not a token yet it's
a but it's a interoperability protocol
and again I haven't spent a ton of time
on it I'm fascinated with this idea of
how the interoperability protocols will
work with these block chase we don't
need a hundred block chains and so how
are we going to go from a hundred to
five or three are they going to just die
or is there gonna be
I need to have find someone smart enough
to explain that to me but it's something
we're looking at we're trying to
understand I don't think anyone
understands it yet but and that's why
you'd talk to the smart guys you know
hey I've been treated wonderfully here
so thank you
you know B I think this is a really
interesting place I had a fascinating
meeting so I think about uber and I
always talk about this idea of a
decentralized Ebor and I met the CEO of
uber we got in an argument and it didn't
end well but he was very it was like
dude you're theoretically maybe okay but
you're dead wrong it's really hard to
build a business and we own those
customers and so we'll decentralized you
repeal to steal ubers customers it's got
two good reasons it'll be cheaper and
it'll be private is that enough
there's a stickiness in the us you know
game what's fascinating about Korea and
I'm just learning this is just met with
a guy who has got a big big established
business and he wants to move some to a
decentralized platform and he was like
well because it's gonna happen anyway so
I'd like to get ahead of the game and I
mean it was in an industry that in the
u.s. no-one's even worried about crypto
there's there there are there are
companies that are doing it but people
think there's no way it'll get
penetration and what was interesting I
was asking them how fast the Korean
consumer is to to adapt it's four to
five times faster than the US consumer
and so in a lot of ways this will be a
wonderful laboratory for daps
once there's a blockchain established
for a music app or a ride-sharing app to
see if people will quickly leave the
Korean version of Spotify to go to the
decentralized version or the creative
version of uber to go to the
decentralized version I think in some
ways Korea has got a better chance of
succeeding than
than the rest of the world and could
become a leader that sounds amazing
thank you that's thanks so much
so our last presenter is Sebastian
Bourget from the sandbox company the
sandbox is a decentralized community
driven platform where creators can make
voxel assets and gaming experience and
monetize them on the blockchain
it features three main components on nft
builder and marketplace and the game
maker sebastian Bourget is the
co-founder and CEO of pixel which is
acquired by animal car ends in 2018 he
is very passionate for blocking
technology gaming and education he is a
very active speaker and evangelist on
the opportunity non-printable tokens
brings to gaming please welcome
sebastian thank you hi everyone I'm very
excited to be here with you it's my
first time in Korea and still and it's
very a pleasure to see so many people
tonight so thank you for coming your
time and learning these new things with
us tonight I'll be presenting on how we
are bringing together users in a
wretched content and non-functional
tokens with yet and Alexandre you've
already learned quite a lot
I hope on what are not fungible tokens
so I might skip on some slides that
might be a bit repetitive to just focus
on what we are doing and that's very
special in the sandbox so we started in
2011 with a big solid building creating
builder games and the sandbox started as
now seven years is our user-generated
content
mobile game on iOS and Android where
players can make their own levels music
picks a lot electronics you name it
using over 500 elements and their shares
of creation and online gallery for other
players to play we've had over 40
million installs to date on mobile 70
million creation made by or a very
active community of creator which is
still 1 million monthly active users big
as of today
and leveraging this experience that
we've had in user-generated content for
these past seven years we've decided
last year to bring our franchise to this
new version this time in 3d using a
multi-platform multiplayer and
leveraging blockchain technology to
empower creators so now the sandbox is
becoming a decentralized committee
driven platform where we are enabling
creators to monetize their time and
skills by selling voxel assets and
gaming experience on the blockchain how
you're doing it exactly so we have three
main components the first one is called
Vox edit it's a 3d software stand-alone
that's running on Windows Mac and Linux
where you can make your own voxel like
voxel being 3d pixel like digital Legos
and start animating them it's already
launched since last December and we have
a great active community using it over
20,000 downloads from digital artists
around the world that made over 2000
models the next step is a marketplace
which will be a which is a web-based
online website where users can start
tokenizing the creation made with Vox
edit and turn them into non fungible
token whether it's year C 7 21 like
crypto kitties or a new standard year C
11 55 which we are building one of the
three main contributors building and
last of all the game maker which will be
a desktop tool for using the tokens that
you've been acquiring on the marketplace
or making with Vox at it and start
scripting to create all sort of gaming
experience so here's the video
[Music]
[Music]
 place
in operation using
dr. MC
[Music]
we also have lands where you can use
your assets creation and build your
words on exploding games and world made
by others
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
all right so I hope you like what you
see and you get a little bit excited
about what we are building like I am so
we are in the space of user-generated
content it's a huge market there's over
half a billion creators out there or to
main competitors are Minecraft and
roblox which minecraft was acquired by
Microsoft for 2.5 billion dollar and
still has over 200 million so close to
100 million monthly active players
roblox the container has been there for
over 10 years and is growing now at 17
million most active players and what
gets me very excited is even it's been
over 10 years already in the space those
games that we all know about they are
still growing and growing massively in
some markets so our positioning is to be
the next builder game where people can
make their own digital LEGO creation
being very accessible yet very powerful
and bring disruption through the
possibility to earn and monetize your
creation thanks to the blockchain so
this just to show that even people still
talk a lot more about fortnight those
days minecraft is still bigger than four
night or up x legend we're using voxels
so Y which was voxel for many reason one
of the one of them is that it's very
easy and accessible even children can
use it we even have a generation of kids
who's played for 10 years minecraft they
are now grown in adult and even it seems
very simple and you can just make
crashing with a few blocks you can also
assemble masterpieces with thousands of
blocks and also a one key reason why
work so is very powerful is that it
never age in terms of look and feel so
we can always increase programmatically
the resolution so that we never see
situation like Second Life etc a kind of
game or wall of Warcraft when you look
at it now it doesn't look as good over
time than it did a few years back and
why we so excited about non fungible
token we
yet explained it quite well before me
this concept of content of the being the
platform and the opportunity of game
item being tokenized and becoming
interoperable across different games
blockchain and platform so that their
value and their utility can grow over
time or never decrease at least and out
positioning is through the voxel editor
and the marketplace we are essentially
providing everyone the tool to be able
to make their very own an FPS and build
pieces of what we call the Metaverse
which is this virtual world where you
can experience all together gameplay and
sell our own content and sell it to
trade it with other players so here's a
quick video of what artists and artist
has done within Vox edits just in two
hours so quite impressive right and this
is something we when we launched the
first version of our editor box edit
back in December we launched a creator
fan of $2,000,000 which was supported
which is still supporting artists around
the world to make those models populate
our marketplace and learn about
blockchain it's been a great success as
you can see artists artists love it and
to date we have over 75 artists working
with us who made all those models and
already 2500 models available on the
marketplace which we'll be launching
soon we're expecting it to launch q3
properly becoming it public in August
and this marketplace is for us an entry
point to bring more people to the
blockchain
so very often you you hear like gaming
will bring mass adoption to the
blockchain which is true we'll really
believe that but we are going to go one
step further and make this extra mile on
going yourself looking for the users and
incentivizing them to install a wallet
and learn about the technology because
they can get a real benefit from hero
here they can monetize their time they
can monitor as a creation be of the true
ownership of the content they are making
essentially help us to build this new
user generated content platform so it's
a win-win for everyone on the technical
side so we've integrated we've made some
choices on the technology so we're
running on if you're on blockchain we
are the only one developing this dual
structure smart contract that relies on
both ERC 7:21 and this news to an audio
CD 155 which has many advantage such as
lower gas fee specifically when the
scarcity of the tokens are is higher
than one and we've implemented things
such as a scroll s auction that allows
to even reduce the interaction with a
blockchain to that a transaction is
registered only when there's a buyer for
the content
[Music]
but anyway that was just to show we also
introduced our own currency
cryptocurrency called Sun which is an
energy 20 it's a utility token that will
be pouring the transaction on the
marketplace for buying and selling the
asset made by the other users as well as
will serve for governance allowing the
community to vote for the next feature
on the project as well as voting on
winner of content etc crowdfunding we
can have creators who are going to
support artists to get the assets they
need for example let's say I want to
make a Jurassic Park game but I don't
find any dinosaur on the marketplace so
I can directly pay for artists to make
the content of this versa I can other
artists make models but not find any
game made using it so will they be able
to come together and pay your game
creator to make a new gaming experience
using those asset and then increasing
potentially the value behind and last of
all because we are in a user-generated
content space it's very important for us
as well to control that people are not
uploading inappropriate content or
copies that could decrease the value
potentially of those non fungible tokens
so we've put in place user-generated
content moderation policies which walk
by like prediction market and people's
taking their token to report
inappropriate content so this is what
here but maybe I'll skip it as a bit
technical here has been already
mentioned so we have built we are we are
going fully decentralized so we also
implemented ipfs so all the content
that's being made and traded on the
marketplace is stored on ipfs and to go
further in this logic of proving the
ownership we are not sorry not only
storing the link to the file on ipfs but
we're also storing the hash of the
content on the main Nate so we have back
let's not forget to let a little bit
less technical now and back more to the
gaming aspect of our platform
so what are or nfg is on the sandbox I
already talked about the asset which are
those models made by the users we have
our own NF tees so on one side we have
the land I'll get to it in a few slide
and you have the avatar which is also
the representation of the player in the
virtual world that can be customized so
each avatar has 14 body different body
parts that can be customized you can
paint the face you can animate it for
and you can change the look and feel so
that it's really your own but you can
use to explore those different land and
play with other in the social experience
as well which is really important so
here is example so the avatar can be
great you know the Fox it eats editor
and animated there so that's really a
main software for us the land of the map
we have a map with over 160,000 parcel
and we'll adopt a similar strategy not
same similar as ax infinity as described
before will not distribute all the land
at once but will sell only about 15% of
them
sorry
[Music]
so the idea is you can buy one lens that
is going to be quite small and take
about one minute to patrol if there's no
obstacles so we'll allow users also to
combine them to make even bigger lands
up to 3x3 with this idea that each land
can be part of six different biomes each
biome has a different scarcity based on
its content so we have the grassland
biome being like this geographical
environment so we have grassland as
about 50% of the different pieces of the
land they are the most basic one with
only 11 blocks and assets then we have
four different biomes ice fire desert
and forest which offer the double amount
of asset inside and last of all the
genesis which is going to be the rarest
with only 2% and contain all the
different blocks which give you all
creative possibilities in terms of
technology again so we'll provide we're
game maker so we want to make sure that
we provide to the developers and
creators all the tools so that it can
create the most compelling user
experience that's why we have developed
our own game engine calories that will
be running multi-platform first PC Mac
and then after we'll add mobile and
console probably in next 2-3 years and
that support both multiplayer physics ai
terraforming and more we want also to
make sure that creators have really all
the freedom to bring their imagination
to life their IDs to life that's why we
offer a visual scripting so when they
are in the game in the world and you can
click on any block or asset and start
selecting and linking the different
blocks to create behaviors and
interaction to different triggers and we
also want implement at the asset level
different gaming characteristic like
attributes as well as make the scarcity
a premium feature so if we limit how
creators can
set the scarcity of the creation we are
also influencing on the marketplace what
can be more or less variable and we
think it makes sense once only a creator
has proven that the content she makes is
valuable that we can walk like that and
overall we'll be able to offer to the
player all sort of gaming experience
whether it's a sport arcade multiplayer
battle game racing or just social chat
room where you come with a friend to
chat and visit around our roadmap so we
already launched our voxel editor
opening the marketplace by q3 around
august and then launching the game maker
in q4 the idea will be every month will
have a major release and keep working
with the community on improving
involving the community in the design of
our feature and the content like we did
with our creator fan already some of our
recent highlights maybe I'll skip that
but we are backed by we just closed 2.5
million investment round supported by
Hodges our lead investor and well I'm
very excited to show you more and more
as we release new content thank you
all right
let's start it okay let me start this
presentation with this tweet is tweet by
Brian Acton he is the co-founder of
whatsapp and this is a very start of
delete Facebook campaign after their
Facebook data scandal Facebook lost like
20 percent of their market capital so
far I see the crag of social giant
Facebook and some journalists some
journalist says that people have lost
faith in centralized social platform
I'm totally agreed in centralized social
platform user contributes to the cross
platform by creating sharing and
interacting with the contents but
platform owners take all the commercial
revenues generated by the platform and I
just see the Facebook cases when the
platform failed to protect personal
information the most of risk is are
always on your side it's quite unfair
TTC is a decentralized and token
incentivized social networking platform
for the next generation social networks
a content generation and social
interaction such as likes comment share
and reporting of each users are measured
and recognized with transparent
transparency and actual commercial
incentives is distributed among users
ttcc issued to the users depending on
their contributions level to this
platform this intensifies users to be
inactive in making contributions and
maintaining a positive and consistent
images on the platform let me show you
around the whole picture of economic
system a fixed amount of token is issued
to the all the users in depth on DTC
ecosystem on daily basis and users can
use the tokens for purchasing digital
items sending virtual goods or exchange
them into cryptocurrency the other
current other currencies in crypto
exchanges third party service provider
also can earn these tokens by providing
services such as emoticon stickers or
chat BOTS advertisers also need to buy
TTC tokens to post advertisements on
deaths in the ecosystem and this the the
token those tokens spent by advertisers
also Lea redistributed to distribute
back to the users the participating
users in the ecosystem yet this scenario
actually helped the gross and
establishment and growth of the social
networking platform in long learn TTC
aim to build a global ecosystem with
various steps on the one protocol layer
which can guarantee the autonomy and
decentralization of taps operation and
also pursue the girl establishing a
decentralized and incentivize social
networking platform TCC foundation will
actually accelerate the growth of TTC
ecosystem of your direct investment into
social networking platform in different
regions with growth potentials
let me introduce the first step Tata UFO
I'm actually diff'ent CEO and the
founder of the of the service and this
is say a social networking service loved
by young and sophisticated 11 million
users in China the position the
positioning of the product somewhere
between Facebook and Instagram actually
by joining in the Tata TTC ecosystem
tata UFO will provide TTC Wallet to
every user in the platform in return
New Jersey Tata fo will be able to mind
TTC tokens with help of token economy
and blockchain technology Tata fo will
expand services beyond the border and
aim to be the largest social network
platform on blockchain compared to
compared to other competitors such as
steam it or some other services they
they merely have less than a million
users but by having 1111 million users
into this this industry will be the
largest social networking platform in
this industry beside beside the Tata UFO
we actually in talks with a couple of
potential depths to join us for example
there is a social sharing services
targeting Eastern Europe and Latin
America with more than 35 million
monthly active users and there's another
video community of targeting teenagers
in the US market with having 500k
monthly active users we are to investing
in the first one by having like 5% to
10% of shares and we are going to
acquire the second video a community
soon and put them into our protocols
this is a long-term goal will be the
biggest social networking protocol in
global presence will be going global
we are not just staying in Asia market
we already started to talking with the
product targeting all around the world
and I found that from protocol
perspective it is actually very easy for
ordinary users to enter into social
networking services meaning from a
product perspective users to be
investors and investors to be users at
the same time so the growth rate the
growth of the social protocol will be a
lot different from other protocols all
the people can participate in the
holding DTC tokens meaning they will be
having really big size of user basis in
terms of wallet holders and when I was
studying the blockchain in blockchain
technology and talking in economy I
found a really compatible to social
networking service density matters
larger user bases will have stronger
network effect it means we'll have more
attraction to the developers in the end
will help the bigger market capital so
in the end I believe that there will be
one or two protocol will survive in in
one segments in one or two years and
will be the one kiss happened
okay let's talk about the more specific
one it's shortened Gor we are getting a
hundred million wallet holders by the
end of the year
it sounds pretty ambitious but we have
very aggressive investment acquisition
strategies you are not just being
sitting there and waiting for the depth
they're coming over we're dropping along
the world and and find those potential
devs and and and get them money and get
them on our protocols and actually I
think it's it's all about exact
execution we are quite different I mean
we are all from entrepreneurs and social
startup industry and we have venture
capital investor experience as well we
are quite different from those pure
idealist developers we are differ from
those the newbie to this industry we are
matured and professional and in this
industry we have frugal record as well
and will be the game changer to this
industry let me introduce our advisor is
actually the first time for me to
disclose our advertisers our advisors in
public
as you can see Simon the CEO and CIO
at hash it his his first adviser to us
and he's also venture partner and
something ventures Andrew is a man
managing partner at another capital he
he was the head of corporate development
at Alibaba Group in China
Martha Jiang is CEO assistant and
blockchain p.m. at bit main technology
is renowned company in in the world and
he's well-connected person in China and
in this industry
Kevin is managing partner at member
capital and he was the CFO at Kingsoft
he was partnering with Lake Jean the
founder and CEO of Xiaomi as well
professor Chinese professor at quantum
school management impacting University
personally I started my company after
graduate after taking his classes
Ryan Lian Kim is ship acceleration
officer and partner at hatchet
most of people here would know about him
so I'm not going to introduce him here
and home a home waits how I call him
loud how he is a business unit CTO at
Baidu and he is renowned blogger and
author of paper and books he has very
strong technology background he was a
staff engineer and kokum as well finally
let me introduce myself
Brian Chiang Korean but based in Beijing
founder as presidents have TTC
foundation I'm also founder a CEO at
Tata UFO I started my company in 2013
I've been raising like 30 million years
dollar so far from conventional venture
capitalists also worked for something
ventures and Central Java province
Indonesia as well I studied economics
and finance at packing University in
China and chase Chang I met the sky
about ten years ago at military camp
after that she went to Senegal and I
went to Indonesia he worked for let Rica
a camera app with download of 300
million and he also walked for line pay
and line Thailand and he was also
workforce often ventures as well he
studied Dali in at University of
wisconsin-madison plus we are actually
established a team with 54 members
including 26 engineers and 5 p.m. and 60
dinars and four-cross hackers so we are
quite differ from previous guys meaning
I mean the in this industry there's a
lots of newbies and small
but we are quite different and will be
the game changer thank you I'm still
nervous anyway I'm sure you have any
question please feel free to let me know
anytime
is from IOT e^x they are building a this
innovative blockchain platform for IOT
which stands for Internet of Things and
they're going to speak about they're
going to tell us about architecture of
their platform and then use cases some
of use cases that can happen using
blockchain in IOT industry
so please welcome Lauren and Kevin thank
you Anna Massey UI everybody so rollin
from IO tax
I'll take Soyoung blockchain startup in
Silicon Valley California so I guess I
can first maybe talk a little bit about
myself then the company so I grew up in
China and I went to school in Canada so
that's where I called my PhD in Waterloo
mostly doing research on the
cryptography after graduation I came to
California Silicon Valley right like
it's a dream for everybody so I worked
there I work in Google working Hoover
mostly I just lived all the security and
the crypto teams at those company which
is fascinating apart from that I'm a
very early believer of Bitcoin and
blockchain technology so actually I'm
the first group of academic readers who
read the pecan paper when it came out in
2000 in Tucson 9 and also I'm the first
group of miners who actually might be
Bitcoin I think back in 2010 something
yeah I have like this big giant machine
just generates a few coins maybe per
month
yeah that was a nice time but I always
want to more besides of investment I
want to use my knowledge use my
technology try to improve how Bitcoin
works how your serum works right so this
dream first finally came true last year
around August
that's when I made my two co-founders
Kevin and also gene and we found this
company called eltechs which is doing a
blockchain for the IOT so and also
thanks for the invitation from hashed
they are very supportive from robotic we
are doing so that's where we are
so the oil tea market is a huge market
so people are visualized the future
societies but
basically everything should be connected
so there will be like 18 billion devices
by the year of 2012 this is a estimation
from famous research institution and the
marketing value for I LT will be like
more than 10 trillion dollars by the
year of 2025 so that's a very huge
market right but are we getting there
like we asked them ask ourselves where
honestly are we getting there looks like
it's still far away like what's the
problem behind this why are we still
like kind of far away all right
it's like any 10 years from now on but
we didn't see everything is connected
right now so we think there are three
problems the most important one is
everything is still LTE devices is still
too expensive because they are so
expensive so it cannot be easily adopted
by everyone it's just like Iran adjust
maybe afford a few devices but not every
devices is affordable so second one is
lack of scalable infrastructure for
example at Google Amazon you have this
huge awesome team working on the
infrastructure so they can have like a
very good infrastructure for their IOT
devices but for lots of small like IOT
vendors manufacturers they really don't
have this back in infrastructure to
support how they are IOT work as a
system so that's why they can
manufacture devices they can ship it to
your home but it's just a single device
it's not connected to the whole world so
that's a second reason this third one is
privacy like we do see privacy is a big
concern where everything is connected
think about like if you if everything is
connected basically everyone knows what
you are doing because right like the
device is around you so that's where the
privacy comes into play but for now
there is basically no privacy at all so
that's why so that's why we're thinking
when we merge splotching and IOT from
two angles like the block shim is solve
the LTS from while the IOT miss or pop
locks from so what is blocking from the
blockchain is a very fantastic
technology it basically can make
everything our asset a crypt asset like
you introduced and make them saleable
and the trail treatable right however
the physical things it's not you there
to be like
bring them on the blockchain so that's a
problem blockchain is facing so that's
why we sing LT Cooke working as the like
a bridge between the physical world and
the blockchain world so that's one and
the folder from the IOT side we think
that like the blockchain could solve let
me go back to the slides so from the
aisle to aisle T aspect to the
blockchain can solve lots of problems
for example X the device is too
expensive but when we extend this token
top academy model to the iot world we
can drive down the cost of the of the
device but make it maybe shareable with
other people by making the data it
generates like to sell it to other
people
so that's why we can just drive down the
cost also we can provide this
infrastructure because blockchain is a
decentralized system so we can't just
provide this infrastructure for
everybody for free so that's how like
the small vendors like even like some
individuals who won't do some IOT the
apps they can use this infrastructure
and certainly is a privacy because
blockchain natively comes with some sort
of privacy not enough but some sort of
privacy which will also be leveraged in
the eye of your world ok so that's a
blockchain plus IOT will work but how
about current blocks you know why don't
you just use zero and why don't you just
use Bitcoin alright so so that's why we
have this table here so we sing collects
the nature of IOT when we think about
the nature of IOT like the IOT devices
they are so different there could be
like a tournament cars it could be as
small as like like a cell phone like a
human like bomb right so they're so
different so it's not easy to have a
like blockchain to just have them work
for every devices so that's that's a
challenge like current blockchain is
facing its for a while and secondly is
the number of devices think about
Bitcoin network think about your network
they're just like a few stunts of nodes
globally not too much but if you think
about like the IOT devices there will be
billion billion of devices so there must
be a way to connect all those device
devices to the blockchain network so
that's a second challenge and server
eyes the privacy like I said like the
privacy for the photocurrent production
there are some some sort of privacy that
means you do an image that means
basically there is no tie between your
personal identity and the address on the
network but however you can
you see like the money flow flows in
flows out for those addresses it can
just not tied it to a person but there
are some some some some some way if you
want so that's why I plug himself has a
very limited support of privacy so
that's a search challenge we're facing
so I'll text is created to solve all
those problems so we have some
innovations here so first of all I want
to talk about like our depots
I think the first presenter or maybe
roughly touchdown the depo scheme which
lots of other production projects that
use but depots basically has some
limitations because it's so centralized
basically these 21 nodes 21 witness
nodes we just control the entire network
right so that's not fair it's not fair
for everybody so that's why we want
enlarge the size of the delegates pool
to make it like a few hundred even few
thousand nodes but like everyone
everyone we will have like a randomized
way to choose maybe a small subset from
this pool to do that to do the consensus
so that's how the RT post works at a
very high level so we are going to
introduce RT post which is both fair and
also efficient a second wall is blocking
in blockchain I think I have a separate
slides for that
so this basically try to solve the
problem in early like if you have two
million devices and each of them at
different how would you like a
commenting them together so that's why
we created this we come up with this
very very good idea
so this means like we have a routine at
the very top and we have side chains for
different applications for example all
autonomous car maybe we was just working
one side chain and all maybe or I don't
know smart home devices they will work
you another chance up chain and also
like a different sub chains they can
talk to each other through the sewer
routine it's like an internet model
right so basically you have this
backbone internet but also you have your
local network at home and each local
word local network at talking with each
other so that's that's basically IDR
between the blockchain implications
architecture
and privacy like I said like Bitcoin
and you serums it provides some sort of
privacy basically you cannot tie the
address to your to the individual but
you can still see since that is going on
to that address right you can see like
somebody maybe send you 10 10 because
somebody maybe just waist wrote in
bitcoins things like that we want to
completely hide those things we want
make like the address just viewable by
yourself but not by everybody else so
that that's a privacy technology where
we are going to we are going to use I'm
not going to to talk too much detail
about privacy but I just want to
emphasize like there are few projects
who are also doing privacy for example z
cache may be more narrow but lock is the
way they are taking is so heavy like
basically they can't we cannot just
migrate them to the IOT world like like
the IOT world they need a different way
of to privacy so that's that's the thing
like we are focused on ok so enough
about technical details so talk about a
token and a usage so basically i otx
network we have 10 billion children in
toto which is a fixed supply I think
everybody likes fixed fixed supply we we
like a pre- more small portion but will
remain like the majority of the portion
for for for the future magnet like the
mining model is similar and bitcoins we
have a few every air every few months
until you to just mining out and the
usage for the tokens are gas or
transaction fees cross stream management
because we have this Christian
communication so we do need some token
to to do to manage how how people do
this cartoon like we want to make sure
like the bandwidth between two subjects
will not be abused and certainly is like
the network wide governance like how do
we vote for the delegates how do we
update the prodigal we have to ask
people to vote so that's that's the
third way of using the token so this is
our road map I will say like this is a
very aggressive road map so basically we
are going to launch your test net in
next few weeks hopefully middle of April
maybe later vapor in the worst case and
we are going to release the minute by
end of this year maybe August or maybe
after that so in between we are going to
we are going to figure out how how would
we implement this privacy technology how
we will how would we do this course
question technology so we already have
some academic paper that is underwriting
and we were releasing as time goes by
okay so with this I'm going to pass it
on to my co-founder Kevin who's going to
talk about ecosystem and community hello
era
I'm Kevin co-founder all right Hank
first of all I'd like to thank everybody
for coming at the ring light it's it's
very difficult for for us to make such a
warm meet up today I'm going to talk
about the ecosystem that our tech is
going to power first of all I'd like to
talk about how we are going to power
different ecosystems as Roland said we
are going to have a auto production we
call it the root chain and that will be
maintained by our tag team and also the
community and on top of that we have the
Auto Tech chain SDK that different
developers can develop their own sub
chains for instance
sharing economy smart homes autonomous
vehicles supply chains different at the
vapor can divide different about the
substance and on top of those substance
there can be even further developers
candy wrappers rtfs we can call it a
modules and the therapy can be injected
into different subjects let's zoom in
into the sharing economy probably I do
not
this is my first time being career I
didn't see a lot in in Korea but however
if you you have read news and there's a
lot in China and you is that different
companies are doing the sharing economy
for example like share the bicycles
people can just deposit their money and
then they can rent a bicycle directly
from the street and in this scenario and
in the in the traditional way people had
to deposit to centralize the company
like Mumbai or other companies and but
however you have no idea how they are
going to do with your deposit but in
power by production it can easily be
done for example I can attack people can
have their own sub chain and also have
their smart contract so that people can
fully trust how the code the smart
contract will do biz their deposit how
it works would be user using their di
ups and to unblock the device through
the smart contract and thus American
writer would hold a deposit and when the
finishes are using the device the the
smart contractor will return the deposit
fully to the user and there's no
relationship between the user and the
company and they do not have to you in
trusted companies you can see oh because
I trusted the blockchain I trusted as
smart contract I can totally do this and
this this further reduce the barrier for
other companies who are doing the kind
of sharing economy you can easily enter
in this field if we take a closer to
look at autonomous cars we mentioned a
lot right now it's not mature yet but in
the future if we emission in the future
how autonomous cars can change to
injured ward and the user would be so
ultimate cards do you operate operate
like a robot you can do their own work
and as you can earn tokens the money and
the user can summon a car for riding and
the numerous cars can come to to offer a
read and the uttermost card because they
are like a robot in the whole ecosystem
they can talk to the route chain and you
can talk to different assumptions to
through the routine for instance there's
lunch and they can update their
operating systems and you can even talk
to the energy chain to charge the car
and you can even grocery surprised and
they can also schedule a car maintenance
because we know their standards you can
you can't do it an automatic autumn
namaste and so this is how we envision
if production plus autonomous vehicles
how it will change the world so this can
be done is a perfect example that the
production can make the robot world more
autumn are autonomous smart home example
can I ask a question how many of you
have your smart device at your home this
is your hand not a lot but probably
everyone has your smart smart phone at
least yeah so but also how much you you
do not have a smart device at home is
that because you do not trust a smart
device you have smart device at home
this is fully really to your day-to-day
life because you can if you have a kind
of camera at home they can monitor you
all the time also they can bring also a
lot of convenience if you are if you
don't look at the condition at home but
also the camera
themself also are looking at the you as
well and if this can be if this is
controlled by a centralized company for
another like a nest being back then by
Google and and some like even not a very
regulated companies you probably
wouldn't trust at all and in this
example production auto production we
can have different assumptions at
different homes and as a result the
devices talk to each other through the
home sub chain so they do not how to
originally the kanockers a cloud that
another company is providing but instead
they are talking to each other locally
the data that the IOT devices captured
just a shared of each his trouser the
transics rather you trusted them and if
necessary you have to talk to the
outside world for in applicants they
want to know the what advisor look like
today they want to know maybe what day
it is today
they can't talk to they can talk to
other productions through the rule
change that attack its providing and in
the future we also think also devices do
the archives they are digital ID and all
the users of course they will have their
wallets they also have ID on the chain
so we will have provided the mechanism
that users reception or like each user
and the device can have their own
virtual ID on the blockchain okay here
are the ecosystem that the attack can
power in the future there are a few
other examples I'm not talking about
today because of the time limit let me
share some amazing updates about our
community within the last two months the
Altai community has has gone to seven
seven seventy six thousand people in the
in the tech community and they are from
all over the world they are from over 50
countries and the iota has been ranked
and number one all the time since we
launched our tech sorry
SEO jobs active products this is a
screenshot I just take
end of the last miles and jerk off early
this is how our tech community spread
all over the world and we can take a
closer look at the career it's it's only
1% so far that's why we are here
yeah we want to talk to you guys and
sorry lights come yeah
we need your help we want to talk to you
we want to make sure you understand us
and also we can help us to spaceward out
the alt tag and also please join too
into our community and we have a lot of
reward programs in our community we have
done a lot for example like the puzzle
that this is actually the puzzle that
you you Berta can also take a picture
and try to solve it at home and it's
very interesting and I want to also
emphasize the charity programs that we
have done recently the first charity
program there within the first two hours
we have a few thousand people signed up
and the vilest and in the end we
selected 3,000 people who you mean truly
police if within the charity program and
we regularly hosted this charity program
the koval charity program will be we try
to fund we try to encourage all the
community members to do charity and as a
result we also give the reward to the
community okay let me briefly talk about
the team so the core team rollin and
rollin and changing the work we focus a
lot on the crystal and the blockchain
they have done tremendous research in
the last few years
crystal and
and the blockchain Jordan was running to
the his introduction she who has seen
worse research scientist tied at the
Posche before joined the team and he has
1014 years research and in the critical
field and me I worked at Facebook before
joining the team and I focus our system
and Crito and a Jing has a visit back
born she focused on community and
partnership she's also here in field
yeah oh there and also we have a Korean
team the team is also distressed they
are mostly in California United States
and some of them are also formed
Southeast Asia and the China these are
our created advisors prof cool attribute
fellow she has been a top scientist in
that way to critic or fee and the track
is is a founding partner of foxing
Foxconn investment and the fan is
founding partner obscura China and we
were we are very honored to have a list
of reputed investors and also the last
row is our strategic partners I would
like to give special thanks to hushed
who has been giving us a lot of support
and who also helped us to set up the
meet up today and also I'd like to thank
everyone for coming tonight
I just thank you gift I would like to do
a airdrop just for people whose three so
night with us and you you can look at
the ho W phone and scan the QR code
if you do not know how to do scan QR
code and you can also tap the the URL
and follow the instruction if you see
the the website and there's a button
redirect you to a telegram bot once you
are in the telegram bot and you can hit
a start and then you you'll get the
bounty
okay that's all for today where you are
claiming your candy we can also take
questions
hi I'm thank you for your presentation
so I have questions in the sub chain
yeah so you said the sub chains going to
be managed locally does that mean that
sub chain is modular and anyone can
connect the sub chain to the root chain
or how is it going to work
yeah so fall sub chain aren't generally
we we'd like to do is to set up a sub
chain well hybrid is very easy for
everyone to set up a substrate as well
but in the smartphone example we like to
also define some standards so that
developers can join the same standard of
the suction at each home so that is a
data can be protected into the sub chain
the hardware will be still the LT
devices and maybe we'll try to lower the
barrier of different developers Ltd
vapors to get his air devices down
through the air tax chain and the sub
J's alright another question stay ok
first thank you for your visit Korea
from long journey from USA and it's like
to ask question about business
perspective and could you explain your
user base and using your platform and I
don't like to know some detail a
practical example where a company
applied your platform and into a
real-life example yeah that's very good
question right now we are actually
talking to a lot of developers also we
can call the partners and they are very
interested in different race I can give
you some examples Wang Jia would be
there's one company who
doing like shared and not shared but can
occur other hiding screens in restaurant
and the shopping malls and they have
deployed over 10,000 screens in
different public spaces and they would
like to using the park chance to turn
their penis model from the very heavily
on BD and they have to do the BD to the
restaurants and and the different
vendors different the real UST donors
and the one returning into the visit as
a company can drive themselves as a
result adult headers can deposit tokens
and their advertising connect materials
into the smart contract so that they are
as being displayed on their screens and
the vendors the route is really the
owners can can't apply users screens
without any talking to any party into
their inner company they want to totally
reconstruct their economy please on our
production yeah this is one example we
can talk more about other examples okay
what say we are building our own chain
yeah
it'll be a sad attack it'll be hierarchy
we have our routine which is completely
new may mention and different developers
can deploy their own sub chain on top of
our attack chain sorry
not not exactly they're knowledgeable
yeah do you want to take this country
yeah like we look around I be calling
you serum they're good right but they
are not designed for IOT there are a
couple of limitations so that's why we
have to build everything from scratch
like the Cody is even like just right
right so so you're saying they're
knowledge proof yeah yeah they were
knowledge proof is cool but it's too
slow like every time you run you can
snarky take a like a four gig of memory
which
not not possible on the IOT device right
so we have like our approach is more
close to the rinsing in each approach
but we want to make it even like even
more lightweight to compare to Mineiro
yeah yeah there will be some technique
details may be in the form of academic
paper in the coming Mouse right all
right okay any other questions did you
guys finish their rope by the way okay
walking this okay okay you have a
question also we have our flare from the
front and if you take one there's also a
QR code you can you can finish your
airdrop yeah try to finish our job
tonight we are going to close by tonight
yeah I have a simple question senior
architecture then you you have a very
good performance and in terms of scale
the scalability is very good but why do
you only focus on IOT just my opinion
your architecture can tackle with the
problem of the sky ability issue main
blockchain protocol have what do you
think about it
yeah I think that's a very good point
so because we reached in like the world
in the future everything is connected
so everything's IOT right so if this one
works for IOT it works for everything so
that's our vision I can later be mom
this is a very good question
so take taking IOT as a first step is
also it's Kanaka we charged a lot of
advantage we can a lot of technology we
can do with auction we I mean I'm like a
we shouts of the how weak we can make is
a production more light more lightweight
and also a very privacy centric and the
per however I think we also want to
focus a lot on the applications as well
and the IOT is such a field that all the
IOT devices is very limited on the
competition power and storage and also a
connectivity as well and this is a
perfectly start point for our tech prop
chain yeah 1200 question I think I
totally agree with you that in the
future you can actually power a lot of
others and also the made out to
different partners some of them they are
not actually doing alt manufacturing the
fine am like as a supply chain they can
be somehow 10 by the LT but also there's
a lot of other fields this not only LT
but they also want to use our production
to do to to to do their work
alright thank you very much so ok
another question
yeah this is about good question to
aunty so stack stacking blockchains is
very interesting but wondering what kind
of attack vector is that open up the
architecture to and and maybe what kind
of problem it will cost for consensus
between the sub chains and the main
chains first technologists consensus
question basically the converse is an
idiot for this
Stackpole action is basically needs
instant finality in order to make this
question has actually really quick
because if you every transaction has to
be like to wait for a few products to be
final then we need to cross transaction
is just a mess disaster right so that's
why we have these two consensus which
has this incident finality which makes
question both deficient and possible and
second attack vector that's good
question but is basically when you open
a perception like because everybody in
this option can attack you somehow right
so that's why that's why we actually
learn from plasma we have to ask the
suction operators to put down a certain
amount of stake unto the row chain in
order to make it work if you like the
sign change they'll have some for a
proof or if you have some do something
wrong like the routine will just shut
down and take all the teeth deposit yeah
yeah alright thank you very much for
your presentation in Korean a please
once again thank you to our IX team
thank you
[Applause]
[Music]
hi everyone I'm Ari and this is Evan my
co-founder we are the team at the
central and the blockchain based virtual
world and today we're going to talk a
bit about what we have been doing for
the past few months and what's next for
us in 2018 but first I want to thank all
the hash team to have us here we
actually were already in this lounge
back in August a few days before our
token sale and have very fond memories
of that one so happy to be here again
here
I broke it
all right cool so we start to work on
this engine because we ourselves are
huge sci-fi fans I don't know if any of
you have seen movies like The Matrix or
read books like ready player one you may
be familiar with the concept of the
murderers the murderers is a shared
multiplayer virtual world in which
humans and human age and computer agents
interact and what all these worlds have
had in common well first of all these
beautiful words are very real they
represent a multi-billion dollar market
some examples are Second Life World of
Warcraft
minecraft which you probably know and
what this virtual would have had in
common over the past two decades is that
they have always been owned by a central
entity what this means is that a small
group of people have had the ability to
determine the fate of the system made of
sauce okay so in beautiful worlds
usually people spend hundreds if not
thousands of dollars on in-game items
and the fact that these items live in a
centralized database means a huge
counterparty risk for instance if the
company is running the servers gets
hacked or if they go out of business as
it happened last year with all states we
are the USA users suddenly lose all of
your game assets also the fact that this
virtual worlds are country controlled by
a central entity means that they have
the ability to do whatever they want
for instance they can print unlimited
currency they can change the rules of
the world and they can even delete the
users so centralization has become such
a huge issue in some of these spiritual
worlds that the users have already put
nicknames on that one example that I
mentioned is Second Life published by
Linden Labs and the users at Second Life
called these acts where they publisher
change the rules of the world acts of
Linden
it's a little
all right cool so we created the central
and to create a virtual world that is
owned by the community and because it is
central it's decentralized it removes
all of this risk that I've mentioned
previously so there are maybe three
guiding principles for the central and
first of all it is owned by its users so
the central is not only an open-source
project is an open economy where all the
virtual space all the land on which the
content happens it's in the hand of the
users also we are creating a system in
which they are not going to be any type
of acts of god what what this means is
that all the items reside on aetherium
smart contracts and as such they're
immutable meaning nobody has the power
to change them what this also means is
that any sort of world change changes of
policies in the game are going to be
conducted through a system of
decentralized governance and lastly
unlike a lot of other beautiful worlds
in the central and we're focusing on the
economy what this means is that by
enabling people to pay and get paid in
cryptocurrency
we are giving content creators the
ability to monetize their content
without intermediaries and without to
happen without having to pay us any type
of fees because in our business model
unlike any publisher or any app store or
any other virtual world the the content
creator base absolutely no fees to us
other than
bind the space in which they publish the
content
so similar like this a multi-user
persistent wall I used to build
technologies
what about to see your IP face which
means that there's no central server
needed that's all oh that we can shut
down your servers and world keeps on
going it's all powered by fear and open
source software with a goal of being
able to continue surviving so that was a
brief overview of what is this engine
and we want to introduce some of the use
cases behind it okay
sorry about that so this engine is
mainly a platform for gaming but also as
a built as a social space is a place for
online communities to develop and to a
lesser extent it's going to be a place
for e-commerce and advertising so let's
talk about gaming so the central in
essence is a virtual world that is
divided in parcels of land a parcel of
land is you can probably understand it
as a 3d domain so on a web domain you
can publish any sort of content and
application on a 3d domain like the land
you can do the same and probably at the
end of last year you became acquainted
with crypto kiddies so cryptic Alice is
a game whose logic resides on a smart
contract and surprisingly enough it was
very popular so this game had a very
basic logic and where you could breed
and make the kiddies and trade them for
each other but they had the peculiarity
that the kid is the the items were
scarce and because of their scarcity and
arguably because of their value they
became very valuable so people became
like very addicted to the logic of
trading this and just like in 2017 we
saw a lot of people investing in USD 20
tokens now towards the end of last year
and nearly this year there are a lot of
projects that are creating games and
people are starting to treat these
assets also us like an investment
so unlike your seat 20 tokens the land
or the crypto kiddies or the items of
any other games they cannot be
represented on any RC 20 token because
they are not fungible what this means is
that each item is different to the other
for instance the land is different from
other land because each land has its own
geographical location and the same goes
with the kiddies
each cryptically has its own attributes
which make it makes it different from
other kiddies and that's why since well
early late last year we've been working
with a crypto key team on coming up with
a new token standard for these items
originally it was the year C 721 but
then we came up with a new standard that
statements going to talk about a bit
more later so the value so when these
games became popular our community
suddenly realized that the center line
was the ideal crate playing around for
these games because even though they're
valuable currently they are only numbers
on a ledger to put in a way and they can
only be experienced on a centralized
website so the central and is going to
service it as a place first where you
can show your valuable items to others
because people like to show off and also
a place where you could integrate those
items into more complex gaming logics
and probably for instance have your CD
fight another kitty or have games that
are already coming up with more complex
that are gaming mechanisms so one such
game is from our front here it's called
human a human is a game where you have
monsters at each of these monsters and
non fungible asset and you can challenge
you can train your monsters and level
them up and fight against cancer
capsules similar to Pokemon perhaps but
it's decentralized and this gives the
users the the certainty that there are
I'm not gonna be eroded in value so
these games have been incredibly
profitable since they launched last
month and they're a team of three people
they've already made three hundred
thousand dollars in revenue and another
sign that this year we're gonna see a
lot more than this of these types of
games is that public companies like but
you or Nettie's in China have come up
with similar games so we foresee that
this is going to be a very large market
in itself and we're going to be focusing
some of our efforts on supporting the
second system so given that it's going
to be such an important thing for us
from the center and from the clothing
system and we're pushing a new standard
which we call the LC 821 the code is
especially some of the things that we
made to this timeline is having useless
gas make it more safe right now there
are about four billion USD lose the
worth of tokens lost in context
so that's why ya see two to three and
seven seven seven are trying to solve
that problem so we've added some
security measures to we're sure that
your contract can spend tokens before
actually sending them so so I'm gonna
talk a little bit about our land sale so
back in August September we had our
token sale and then we start immediately
working on while growing the team but uh
other than that on distributing all the
land on which people are going to create
the content so we did this in two
different ways because people in our
community wanted to own the land
privately but they also wanted to
participate in larger projects so for
those that want to participate in larger
projects we gave them the ability to
publish proposals for what we call
districts a district is basically a
group of people that has a shared
interest or a share aesthetic for
instance a cyberpunk city so we created
a aetherium application where any of our
users could use the mana token to buy
land and send it to the districts the
most popular district is the one that I
mentioned call etherion and people
contributed over a million dollars worth
of land to their district surprisingly
right and also to
the other way for us to distribute the
land was to have an auction so the
reason we had an auction was as I said
all the lands had their own location so
they were they people thought of
different lands as having different
value because of their location mainly
because we specified that the users
would all spawn or appear in the center
of the world so naturally all the lands
that were nearby that Center people paid
a lot more for that than the ones
farther out so we sold the total of
slightly over 70,000 land parcels and
people spent a little over sixty million
dollars at a time
so this was not another token sale - for
this people you start talkin re FC
Twente token called manna and as they as
they used to token he didn't come to us
it was just burned so a total of 160
million mana will burn and that
represented 15% of the circulating
supply and that was just the first sale
we're probably gonna have another one in
May couple or so months after we shipped
all the products so this is what the map
would look like after the auction so the
gray and white areas are public roads
and public classes respectively so you
cannot own this part and the content of
the classes is going to be determined by
the community either by voting or by the
community renting them off to projects
or anyone who wants to put their content
there because it's very valuable space
then the light blue areas are all these
districts Asteria which is the largest
one is the one on the upper right-hand
corner and there were a total of 55
projects of this kind so a lot of them
are online communities that just want to
have a place to hang out like they do on
online chats others are like private
groups that want to create business or
games there all of all sorts you
go to our github to see them and finally
the green parcels are the ones that were
bought privately by individuals so the
way this work is that you could bid on
the land and someone could out beat you
so we ended up having like a bidding war
and people ended up paying like very
pretty significant money for this so
this is a visual representation of what
they what the relative price of the
parcels was so the areas that are in
lighter red mean that they were more
expensive and they're pretty like
fascinating patterns here so you can see
that people paid a lot more for areas
around the classes and around the roads
and also for some areas that are next to
the districts to give you an idea the
land that someone paid the most for its
one land right near the center and each
land is a ten by ten so pretty much like
this room and the highest bidder paid
about ninety thousand dollars for a
single land but the average price for
all the lands were three hundred dollars
each and for the ones in the inner
circle so in the areas closer to the
center we're about two to three thousand
dollars so this is another visual
representation of the price it's
supposed to be moving but as you can
tell the land parcels near the center
people paid like a lot more relative to
the rest okay and I wasn't going to
present this but so we as we are going
to support a lot of projects that have
non fungible tokens as their bases we
are we started to design and work on
coming up with a decentralized exchange
where all these projects can sell their
tokens so this is going to work as a
it's going to be be centrally curated so
it's going to be a talking curated
registry basically where there are
people that have an incentive
to keep the content on the marketplace
good because that will drive the value
of their talking stuff okay
so some project updates since then we've
got a lot of things working on different
projects and contexts we're releasing
tomorrow or this way a lot manager for
the people that participate in the
auction to buy to transfer back and
forth to other users and this lab
manager is slightly going to become the
center exit marketplace and which is us
testing the technology
I usually just mention this
decentralized exchange we are going to
be able to finance all and directly
without any counterparty risk because
it's just a smart contract
cos we fortune can see languages to
developers use to upload content to
content
[Music]
the current status of all of that the
CLA also communicates with your servers
because up until now we are centralizing
the NTFS part a little bit deeper making
sure that we would provide some
availability for all of the content all
of the 3d models and all of the textures
that they that our users are using to
serve to serve their van courses we the
most important aspect of the project
they climb the world Explorer and still
in very early stage we're working with
some games two years and companies and
creating a domestic case so we can make
sure that they can create their
experiences and have their games inside
of the world we've also had that team
working on the performance of this
because it's pretty heavy we need to
keep at least 60 or 90 frames per second
so that our users component because
that's that's a pretty big requirement
from there you see Nanyang itself we've
got the team working on the VR
interactions how is it going to come the
world and a few transactions can be
the landowner and other with new service
cabinets and 92 other users in a safe
way
how am I going to shiny objects let's
get the team work in your content
moderation which is for all the content
that is served from our own servers we
need to be sure that it's appropriate
for the audiences so we were taking a
proactive approach and not one reactive
approach to make sure that people don't
see things that may be of lastly
research we're working on scaling out of
different ways number one is doing
things similar to what you believe the
option the option was Han of changing
process in the sense that everybody
input and their manner in order to
participate in the ocean the ocean was
always very far away and at the final
stage back into the blockchain so not
allowing us to have all the beads and
all of the different all of the
different actions that the users to
during the option have been really have
been really fast but they still having
the cryptographic certainty that that's
just process so that's number one way in
which we are trying to scale for
transactions number two is with starting
research presentations we've got some
process we're also talking with
creating different plasma
implementations out there were other
ways to skate but do something took many
months which is so that's kind of what
is working on I wanted to share as well
what are we going to work on next we are
organizing the work of teams are doing
different things
another one is to traditional assets
inside of the world another username is
to expect
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
we're also coming up with
I'm sure that been the Ford experience
is a good one
we're working with the district leaders
how can we make the experience of
managing deploying them all of their
land being in an effective way because
these are very very famous organizations
some of them are groups of seven and
people some of them are two or three
some of them even disappear
subway smaller ones so we also
absolutely trying to automate with some
through different ways right now we're
going to integrate we start to have
people look at screenshots of the world
and judge whether that content is
suitable for all audiences
next we'll be working on having hearings
not only like this many of collectibles
for example the project that I just
mentioned
we're looking for to have users
we're hoping people can buy and sell
these collectibles inside of the
experience we're working on we've got
almost ready which was government's that
something issues and simple
[Music]
history's better tools for these
districts to organize themselves because
they've got some parts of their
districts are public places there are
there are some parts that they are
renting some of the guys in the
community are coming up with smart
contracts to rent the land of users so
there's a lot of possibilities in there
in the future opening up different use
cases like big variants which require
different level of scale once we
without the other user stories so that's
pretty much it that's a current status
and what we were looking forward in the
future
you're like the presentation
thank you very much
[Applause]
forcible thanks for your presentations I
have three questions the first of these
actually I heard about kind of the
command-line interface I think it's as a
sport only for the initial developer
actually we are looking for access to by
an age so yeah do you have a plan about
some for users their normal users to
view their own construction of their man
like app so user former years of graphic
editor its first the second is actually
here in Korea we already invest many
lands to the district for example legacy
as we se but those are their real easier
than the hi paper supply paper and they
even released a try to just really make
us coins inspector but others just keep
mom we have any information from that so
I do you have any plans to control
district second-last
is we are eagerly waiting for this time
is the edge of the bronze image so we
really wanted access to right stage
because we want to sell in pass them
lands
thanks for your questions so I think the
first question was about whether we will
have tools for the end user to be able
to create content so actually before we
release the CLI we were working on an
end user tool like a drag-and-drop
editor but we realized and by talking to
other projects that have done something
similar we realized that our focus
should be initially on the developers
because they are the ones that with the
least amount of effort from our end will
be able to come up with the highest type
of quality because on the comment line
you can create you can use arbitrary
sold and create more complex experiences
than what we will be able to deliver
with a drag-and-drop editor in action in
a matter of months so our focus at least
initially it's only going to be on
developers so the way this is playing
out for individuals we opened up a
marketplace where actually we partner up
with a district 0 which has influenced
it lenses say a marketplace for
technical talent so what a lot of people
are doing it's just us contracting or
hiring 3d developers artists so that
they can build it for them and in the
for the districts that way it's playing
out this a lot of them have internally
some developers and they have those
developers create the content for all
the districts or they are as well
subcontracting to other people so in a
nutshell initially the the focus is
going to be on developers and later on
but it's not our focus now we're going
to eventually have tools for the
end-user so the second question I'm
going to ask you to repeat it so it was
something about the districts so I mean
our view with decentraland is that once
the land is in the hands of the of the
users we don't really want to meddle
with what they do or
they don't do but let's say for the past
maybe month people were most more
focused on acquiring the land and but
over the past a couple of weeks we start
seeing a lot of the projects come up
with public proposals of what exactly
they're going to do on the land how
they're going to get there how to budget
for it and actually from the central and
we've been like offering them help
whether it's technical or maybe some
initial funding so that they can get to
an MVP but the idea for us is that they
will be able to be on the wrong like we
don't want to we want to help them get
started of course and we're going to put
effort on that but we're not going to be
moderating what the users do and the
third question could you repeat it for
me please okay so so he presented all
the projects that we have ongoing and
until we launched the public product is
going to be at the very least six months
so until then what people are going to
be able to do is buy the land by land at
the marketplace and build the content
and maybe share the content with other
people but the and experience of the the
web browser client or the VR client are
now going to be publicly accessible
until much later this year because this
so while we like creating everything in
the open because we are used to building
open source software since we are sort
of like a public company it's very
important to have like a good release
where everything has all the Kings have
been ironed out so we're going to delay
that release until we have like a good
final version so to give you an example
we were just talking to to a gaming
company and they told us that it usually
takes about two years for them to
release anything and we finished our
token sale in September so I think we're
moving really fast we grew our team from
five to twenty people in the past month
and a half but it's going to take a
little bit of time however we're like if
anyone's really like keen on seeing what
we're doing we're opening up the client
to some early adopter so we can start
getting filled out how it works and we
can develop it along along those needs
thanks for your questions
well first of all thank you for being
here in Korea so let me get this
straight so there are lots of use cases
right gaming ecommerce online
communications but you said mainly
gaming will be means focused area so
whatever your specific reasons why
gaming or like do you guys have better
environment for our gaming development
so it's a matter of focus we can only
cater to one thing at a time and in
every startup you always have to try to
solve one problem very well before you
expand on other areas so if we didn't do
that we would be at risk of not really
solving anything well and initially
we're going to have an approach of being
like a general-purpose open which will
work from the very beginning but given
the attraction that all the games are
having and there's a very good
differentiator for for us when we
support crypto collectible based games
and the market is seeing that I mean
actually it's it has already become a
good business use case so we're going to
pursue that initially however I mean
we're still developing some of the
functionalities that would enable things
like communication for instance pretty
much from the beginning you're going to
be able to talk to people via voice and
text chat so that's going to enable
other types of of interactions but most
of our marketing resources and business
development resources and development
resources are going to be focused on
making projects like a tournament very
successful in the central and before we
move beyond that then we really
are you guys a big gamer like me yeah so
I mean while growing up I used to be
playing games all the time and like
online multiplayer games nowadays I
don't play as much because I work mostly
and also I was a big fan of collectible
card games like Magic the Gathering
and that's why our talking is called
mana goodness
the Tribunal's about stability Colorado
Google
[Applause]
hi joy thank you for joining us supposed
to be in great let's start by getting to
know you better tell us a little bit
about yourself
so I mean I I think I've mentioned to
you before Jemma I started in this place
quite a quite a while ago so it was five
six years ago and it was really the kind
of zapper initiative at the time they
were looking to build out an electronic
money license framework for the Fiat
elements are there that they can wallet
and lots of conversations with them
mostly with the wences Casares you know
he said to us like Gibraltar small
jurisdictions you know you have a
competitive advantage you are able to
adapt to new things much faster than
larger entities like like large
institutions I suppose and and he
encouraged us to approach the government
at the time with the concept of building
out a purpose-built
ground-up regulatory framework for the
use of distributed they just technology
at the time it was mainly sort of crypto
focused but you know evolved quite a bit
so we started that process a long time
ago and that law came into effect a few
a few years ago my background is in the
financial services etc but as I spent
more more time I mean I'm now almost a
hundred percent dedicated to the law and
regulation this Basin because we were
effectively I mean certain extent
pioneers we were the first curious
diction to introduces it's it's
generated a lot of interest from lots of
other countries so and that that's one
of the reasons I'm involved in so many
different initiatives around the world
so sort of share some of our experience
which is yeah then very steep learning
curve a wonderful development is less
and for a business to succeed I think
it's really important to have legal
certainty and I know that your altar has
been paving its way for developing a
principle based regulatory framework
yeah and I know you've been very
involved in that process
so could you tell us a little bit about
that as well yeah I mean you know it's
it's again it's it's interesting for
lots of different people to hear in
different jurisdictions so the way that
the reason that we approach this from a
principals perspective was so we looked
at what had happened in the world we
looked at things like the bit licensing
in New York you know super codify and
details and hundreds of pages of
legislation we looked at existing
financial services law and its
development and over many hundreds of
years etc and we we took the view that
because this industry so fast-moving and
so fast evolving and it would be very
difficult to codify a detail set of
rules that would be adequate real and
appropriate in even six months so the
way that we approached it was to define
what we feel are sort of core principles
relating to a well-run business and they
relate to I mean very specific things
relating to this industry so
irrespective discuss the arrangements
and respects of its security
arrangements and respect of its capital
arrangements and respect of its
governance structure and etc etc but
accompanying those guide those
principles we have much more detailed
guidelines so the the interpretation of
that principle is in more detailed
guidelines and those guidelines because
they're a form part of the law can be
emerged and adaptive and
very very quickly so we that was a way
that we felt it was most appropriate to
try to keep track of development and and
keep keep emerging and changing those
guidelines to adapt to those principles
that was what we thought was the most
appropriate way of repression and and
you're actually right why do people come
to why would people set up their
operations in Gibraltar you know it's
absolutely a question of legal certainty
regulatory certainty tech certainty and
these are these are very very key
principles which in the in the old world
are taken for granted in the new world
they're they're high risk
there are many jurisdictions where it's
not really clear of whether you fall
within the scope of some existing law or
outside the scope and no one wants to
operate within a gray area it's insecure
for the business and it's even more
insecure for the customers that that
businesses is serving so we've I think
had a lot of success and the standards
are very high I mean that's another very
important thing because we I've seen
some jurisdictions introduce what I
would say are very base layer
registration requirements very very
simple and and that to me is is honest
and we've learnt from that in the past
they've been jurisdictions that have
tried to do that try to open the doors
very very wide and the way that we've
approached this is to set the by
extremely high and because we're a small
jurisdiction we're not interested in
running 500 exchanges from a small
region we want to be selective we want
to set the bar very high and attract the
right groups and build the right
community around that so that that is
what has driven the whole initiative and
there's been a lot of work great
and speaking of other jurisdictions yeah
how would you distinguish Gibraltar from
other jurisdictions such as Hong Kong
yeah I mean for me it's very it's it's
different I mean I've got I've got lots
of good things to say about what the MAS
and what the teams are doing in Hong
Kong you know one I suppose one example
in in in Singapore might be that you
know following the recent you know fad
of guidelines and everything else they
encourage this risk-based the fatty food
crisis risk-based approach to regulation
or registration
they've also defined the sort of
threshold limits from an amount
compliance perspective at 1,000 euros or
dollars occasional transaction that was
there Singapore of approach that at zero
so you know $1 triggers of a requirement
so they're very conservative from that
perspective others feel that a thousand
years is wait to learn that that's but
but then the flip side of that is that
most of the larger jurisdictions and I
would put Singapore and Hong Kong in
those senses it's very difficult for
them that they sit on existing large
infrastructure and large businesses very
difficult for them to to build out
entirely new frameworks for a new and
emerging area that the big organizations
big regulatory authorities so what I've
seen is I would say that Singapore them
more active they remember their payment
services active or bill which has passed
and comes into effect on the first of
January and it will specifically capture
lots of activity in
in the space it will cut it will
definitely capture exchange related
activity but then the it would not cover
from what I understand you know custody
related activity which is also one of
the fattest recommendations so I think
they are probably already looking at
trying to evolve their law before it's
even coming to the fact that they're
probably looking to try to do that but
it's it's different to I suppose Hong
Kong where again I think they're they've
just try to place this these new
services and new facilities or business
types definitely within old existing law
so if you operate from what I understand
under an existing license in Hong Kong
you're able to add certain activity
related to crypto related business but
you're not able to apply for that
license if you're just a crypto related
business which is slightly odd things
are that that would also lead to groups
trying to apply for licenses that
doesn't really cover the activity that
they're conducting just to tick the box
to be able to facilitate the business
and they're actually doing it wouldn't
make sense for me in ultra simplistic
terms to obtain a brokerage license for
one equity and actually conduct a crypto
OTC business it doesn't really it
doesn't really make sense but but at
least it's emerging in both
jurisdictions in both Hong Kong and
Singapore I think there are lots of
smart people lots of big community of
users and but moving regulatory
authorities and government institutions
just takes longer I mean it just it just
and that's small you know though these
are the big jurisdictions but relatively
speaking when you start talking about
the US or other larger that's even
harder so that and that and I suppose
you put us at the diametric opposite of
that where it's much easier we we feel
in smaller jurisdictions I think we feel
we have to evolve we have to adapt to
new things if if if London or New York
or Singapore Hong Kong say we're let's
sit on our existing business and and
facilitate the the activity that we have
is no there's no problem but in in
smaller jurisdictions unless you're
evolving in my view you know if you were
to sit on what we had for 15 years it
would be the end of the game you have to
keep evolving to keep up with
development so that's kind of what we're
doing I guess it's really interesting
for me to hear because I think you are
in a very unique position having been
involved with the regulatory side but
also you know having your own private
so from the regular interest regulators
perspective how do you balance nurturing
entrepreneurship but also you know
dealing with some of the risks that are
involved so what advice and how would
you strike a nice balance between the
two yes that's oh that's a difficult one
I mean I think I mean I think in some in
some jurisdictions they've approached it
from a kind of let's call it the sandbox
perspective and that that is their
facilitator or call it incubator for
allowing businesses to operate and
normally it might be to certain
restrictions or certain levels or
certain transaction volume limits or
certain number of client limits so it's
a kind of testing environment and that
is generally seen as quite positive even
more positive on that for some people
would say let's develop you know not
even a sum of just self-regulated or
groups or authorities or standards where
the industry itself and if the regulator
accommodates that effectively you're
allowing a new type of business to
incubate itself and the environment and
the platform and everything else within
rules that are set by the industry
itself from my point of view you know
self regulated bodies organizations it's
great that they can work to define
principle there's no enforcement powers
from a self regulatory authority so you
operate in two standards if you operate
into those standards that's great if
you're not who does anything against you
and with the sandbox I think that it's
great when when some some jurisdictions
do that and that there are accommodating
things and but at the same time might
maybe it's too pessimistic but they're
also you know sandbox is a kind of
restrictor you're not really validating
the business
not licensing the business you're not
putting on an even keel with other
existing financial services businesses
so it's good that it's facilitate but it
ain't at the same time it's kind of
restricting it it's kind of closing
closing it out so the really difficult
piece for a start-up that kind of
thinking is to find places that will
actually validate what you're doing
actually license what you what you're
what you're doing recognize what you're
doing and which gives a massive amount
of comfort to banking service providers
other more institutional related groups
insurance providers or that providers
feel regulated business that you're
licensed it's just different and so
maitain but finding finding the right
framework to license and protect
consumers within an operating model that
also accommodates and allows for a kind
of incubator style
startup that's that's very difficult
that that is very difficult so we have
our own approaches to that and lots of
everyone has slightly different
approaches to that but I would be
encouraging people to find the right the
right model that fits for them and
definitely not to try and avoid it I
mean I add the groups that you know
there are groups that set up in you know
whatever some jurisdictions somewhere in
the world some Island or whatever it is
and because they feel that they're
allowed to do whatever they want and
that that to me it's just it's such an
obvious danger signal and I I can't
believe that serious people would would
would think about doing that today so
but targeting the base and setting the
foundation layers on day one is super
important trying to transition from a
bad environment to a new good
environment is extremely extremely
difficult so setting the foundation
taking those difficult decisions
you know investing yourself having the
right backers like like hash I mean it's
a hugely significant passive of what
these groups can do I would say those
were fundamental for all of these guys
and I think crucial elements of that is
being educated and being able to share
some of the knowledge and I know that
you've traveled the world to talk with
regulators and I know for instance you
are very much involved with the und FC
the Wharton rec tech initiative yeah how
would you summarize some of the global
regulatory landscape at the moment I
would say it's it's I would say it's I
would say it's dramatically different
it's really really dramatically
different when you know jurisdiction by
jurisdiction so you know sometimes or
some people or some idealist always
saying oh you know there should be a
global standard for regulation of
control or token categorizations I mean
I that that for me is just it's just a
complete pipe dream I mean in some
jurisdictions like in Thailand they have
they have recategorize different kinds
of Turkish to put them within separate
brackets but most interestingly other
than that as opposed to say Switzerland
which has has a kind of utility versus
payment versus security categorization
they've they've introduced and Thailand
the concept of an investment token so an
investment token that has no traits of a
of a traits of a security but doesn't
itself doesn't categorize itself as a
security but it has a separate class and
it's recognized in the set in a separate
way and they've put a lot of things
around that which is actually very very
interesting but but the reason I'm
saying that is try and get 50 other
regulators to acknowledge and there's an
investment token as I can to try and get
the you know the u.s. or the SEC
to recognize a new class of non-security
investment liked it that is I do think
that that can happen in other
jurisdictions like in suppose in
Australia Australia they they've
introduced our license or registration
regime and I think if they look at
certain things they look at that the
people that are involved they look at
the company etc but they don't really
beyond that they don't go to the more
complex and it's my understanding so the
actual infrastructure of that business
the requirements are very very simple so
they're encouraging the environment to
grow they've had you know 250 groups or
exchanges regulated or licensed or
registered in about a year and that that
could potentially open many other danger
signals in South America and it's very
different I think there there's less of
a focus in some jurisdictions like
Mexico there are big communities looking
to evolve the law there's a transition
phase now sort of FinTech law transition
period that they're in at the moment but
again some of the bigger groups in
Mexico that we work with you know have
started the operations we have bits as
one of those the largest exchanges in
Latin America you know we've done that
in in consultation with the regulator
Mexico etc - - because you know they
don't want to regulate that business and
we provide a safe environment to
actually control that and that should
also provide comforts of a mixing
releases but every everywhere is sort of
and and there are some jurisdictions
where to be honest I won't name them but
that they don't really understand I
would say to have it yet come to really
understand what what this means I think
historically there's been a very obvious
AML focus
everything's been around a mile and
and compliance starting back with an
expose in 2013 with Flynn sent in in the
US where they recategorize virtual
assets as effectively as a currency and
brought them within the scope of our
money service businesses etc but that
was that was very a mild focus and in
lots of jurisdictions I think the focus
is still on that which in my experience
dealing with some of the businesses that
I was dealt with and I just think that's
it's just too simple
initially the focus was all around money
laundering but if this is really going
to grow into something more serious you
have to look at those arrangements if if
quadriga is hacked with hundreds of
millions with BTC stolen etc it does not
matter what the AML processes were and
that they could recognize everyone had
lots of money they had no custody
arrangements they had no security
arrangements in place they had no
insurance cover there nothing in place
and which led to a significant loss that
could not happen to a properly regulated
and controlled business so I would hope
that I think all regulators are the
starting point
all of them have seen the FATA
recommendations all of them have seen
the vasp categorization with some of its
and adds up to them to see how they're
going to break up but I often say to
countries or over to to regulators I
mean you cannot do nothing you cannot
sit on the back fences as some of them
were doing
year ago so it will continue to evolve
it'll be a very interesting next 12
months and I think you're right to point
out the fattest because what's the big
conversation industry for the virtual
assets and virtual assets providers
service providers and what may be given
your industry knowledge maybe you are
able to quickly anticipate some of the
shortfalls and I think one of them being
mostly debated issue around the travel
rule yeah would you be able to comment
yes yeah I mean I mean generally
speaking very high level I would say I
mean outside of the travel rule just the
the categorization of a virtual ISO
service provider so to give you one
simple example in Europe the European
Union has developed its you know fifth
anti-money laundering directive comes
into place in March and and covers
certain services so certainly custody
related activities would be would be
covered certainly exchange related
activities where there was a Fiat touch
point would be covered and that there
are there are many inconsistencies
already between the fifth antimony new
directive which hasn't yet come into
place and the definition of a virtual
active service provider so already that
this sort of it's a strange sort of
situation where the Union is moving in
one direction to categorize things and
it's kind of already out of date with
the definition of what FATA furtive what
the finalization
service provider and other jurisdictions
have to find that in different ways and
there are a lot of interpretation issues
about what and what what a virtual
assets is probably actually means so
that is one to discussion point if you
like and that will be for each
jurisdiction to interpret the
recommendations etc unless even more
guidance that's offered but yeah they're
really contentious one is is the is the
travel rule and for those are aren't
fully aware me I'm only saying because
not everyone is even fully aware that
recommendation 16 is is there but
there's there's if you're onboarding a
customer and your wallet provider
exchange or whatever it might be you're
going to always have an obligation to
identify who that person is that's
always been that within within any base
form of regulation and what onboarding
but the travel rule introduces an
obligation for a transfer from a virtual
asset service providers for the
originator to identify the beneficiary
now that that copies the swift payment
system and on the banking network and
rails which is completely normal
although the assistance the Swift system
has been subject to all sorts of abuse
in the past but it's encoding that sort
of theory or principle within the crypto
space now that that is very difficult
for so if you're transferring from an
originator to a beneficiary I mean the
first point is the transfer to another
vasp is what triggers are requirements
for you to identify who that that
beneficiary how do you even identify
that the wallet that the transfers be
made to is itself linked to a virtual
asset service provider and that's not
flying ledger wallet whatever might be
someone's individual personal offline
that's just a space starting point the
other more complex point is even if
you're able to identify who that virtual
that the world is linked to a virtual as
a service provider and the travel rule
recommendations are are triggered how do
you actually do that how are you going
to encode someone's personal data to to
a transaction you're gonna encode it on
the actual chain is it a side chain that
attaches to that transaction I mean
there are many different with there are
also some issues around that I mean one
of them one of the most basic ones is in
relation to you know gdpr and data
privacy related things if you're locking
someone's identity to a transaction on
an immutable ledger that sits there
forever that that's a huge or that
doesn't work so how do you do that in a
safe and efficient way and again in this
in the travel rule we found our own
working group with with very very
specialist providers and it's relatively
what's it's definitely closed because I
feel that we have to have representation
from the compliance industry from the
analytics industry from the industry
from the actual providers and really and
obviously the the legal input as well
lawyers are very important but that
that's that that works in a certain way
and the reason that I've done that is
that there are so many different big
groups that have been formed and again
some of it's very it's it's it's it's
lovely and but it's very idealistic but
you know there's going to be some
centralized nonprofit organization where
every virtual asset service provider in
the world will register and centralize
its data and information and all of the
wallet addresses and everyone's personal
data will be controlled by this
nonprofit and see any that that I just I
just and people will say well that's how
the Swiss started and I just cannot see
that
happening so there's no there's no
there's no short-term immediate answer
to the travel rule but what there are
lots of working solutions and lots of
people approaching this and slightly
different ways well the way that we're
approaching is we already regulate
virtual asset service providers you know
we already have that law we've already
been doing that for two years well not
there's nothing new for us the travel
rule is something new for us but we
already have the pot and the the
regulation of vasp so we're adding that
facility through a very specialized
service that we want to be able to offer
to regulators virtual Assaf surprise at
least him in in Carrozza and if we see
that working then it will be something
that of course we'll be discussing and
opening to the rest of the world so I
would like to end this interview by
doing our signature move at hushed which
is you know our brand yeah could we do
that show by to actually absolutely
great
three two what hashed thank you
[Applause]
everybody thanks for coming
well let's see one I guess when I
appreciate you coming here because I
know it's rush hour
right so the traffic is insane soul I I
don't know how you guys do it so it
takes like an hour to get from anywhere
it anywhere but but anyway I love the
city as you know most Americans only
know one part of Seoul Gangnam right so
we only know so and but but I'm learning
some of the other parts so how many
people here have bought Bitcoin when you
everyone hears about Bitcoin okay
alright so now what we're gonna do is
we're gonna figure out who's the who's
Oh G alright who's who's who's the
original original we're gonna find out
who in the room is the first buyer of
Bitcoin so raise your hand if you bought
a Bitcoin in their first Bitcoin in 2017
first Bitcoin 2017 okay alright first
bit well who did a Bitcoin first one in
2018 nobody okay
well one person okay who had their first
Bitcoin 2016 okay anyone else know
okay first Bitcoin 2015 2014 alright
2013 okay okay 2012 no that's me my
first 2012 2011 Satoshi Satoshi here
no alright I got asked every room I
figure he's hiding right he's like in
every room he's at every meet up we just
don't know it
okay alright well you know if you've
been in Bitcoin for a while you know
that this thing constantly changes
constantly evolves and it was just a
matter of time until video games and
cryptocurrency
became friends okay
and when we say friends like some really
really exciting things have happened so
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna talk talk
about what's changed in the past year or
so and how video games and
cryptocurrency
are now like really doing some exciting
things now most people here being in
Korea know a lot about gaming but the
thing that's really interesting is how
money has evolved so think about it the
first kind of money was people doing
barter right people just change hey I
have a sheep you have a goat you know
we'll trade so eventually people made
something to represent it so they would
use shells right to represent the things
that they were trading and then they'd
use gold precious metal right which had
a value and then you could change the
value for the thing then they had these
things which were basically pieces of
paper notes and then they became real
banknotes issued by banks and now we
have crypto currencies so money is
evolving because you know today we have
about a hundred and eighty currencies in
the world but you can see there's
already 1600 crypto currencies it's
probably gone up one or two while I've
been standing here so why is that why is
there so much more crypto currency why
is it evolving so much faster this this
process took thousands of years to get
to a hundred and eighty fiat like you
know regular money but it's taken us
like a couple years to get to 1600s so
that why is that well part of it is
people also love to trade like trading
is what like we do not just for for fun
but also you know to make a living so
it's just kind of like part of what we
do so they've been trading you can see
these beautiful drawings thousands of
years ago and you can see people you
know trading today it's part of like
what we do it's like we're wired okay so
now that we spend the majority of our
waking hours in front of a screen right
looking at a mobile phone looking at a
PC you say well trading would would
obviously then also occur in the virtual
world right it's what we do we've been
doing it for thousands of years so
that's what I do okay
I sell skins and skins are literally
just your virtual identity it's how you
look in a game it's how you look to your
friends so we're all born with a skin
right but that's not the only one we get
to play with in a virtual world we can
change our look we can have what looks
like a tattoo we can you know put things
on our hands or on our face and if any
of you have used snapchat you've seen
filters right there's lots of other
programs to do filters but these are
just skins skins just change the way
things look so here's a game many of you
may know this is a very successful game
pub G one of the most successful in the
world for a style called battle royale
right and so this is your avatar without
much going on this is the avatar with a
very cool jacket that jacket is not
cheap it's not free that cost money
here's another game okay here's here's
my rifle it's very plain looking you see
it's green it's not very interesting
this is it with a really cool looking
skin on it you can see right it's pretty
sweet now why is this interesting well
because you know I get social status
right this game has designed them so
they're one-of-a-kind so they're unique
they're collectible and they're valuable
so how much do you think people would
pay for something like this
we just sold one sixty one thousand
dollars actually I think I think that's
a wrong number right isn't it off by a
couple zeroes yeah it's three zero so
there's there's three more zeros I was
just thinking about this I was like this
is how much my cab ride was and that was
right Cameron was definitely not $61,000
there's three zeroes missing here yes
I'll have a talk with the editor but
anyway yeah so 61,000 you asked 66
million won so why let me show you
something a little video clip to give
you an idea of how people react to this
so I don't know if you've any of you've
been that excited to get a Bitcoin know
maybe December and you found some
Bitcoin you forgot about right okay so
this is how people react to it and so I
you know everyone asked me why why why
why why so I figured I just answer the
question for you there is are the four
happy chemicals okay these are the four
happy chemicals if you get one of these
chemicals you find something enjoyable
if you get two you will go back to it
over and over if you get three you get
addicted if you get all four well I
guess there's no reason to leave your
house right so these are really really
important and these these chemicals are
why we do anything and so skins give us
these really happy feelings just like
having a really nice car or a designer
handbag or anything else that connects
with status belonging and a feeling of
connectedness so our business is based
upon the trading of those items we are
the largest platform in the world so
think of it like Amazon for virtual
items okay so that's what we do and we
have this centralized business it's very
successful it's only three years old
but we dominate that space and the
reason why we do so well is because we
solve three problems there's a lot of
theft because it's all online and you
know hackers love to steal things that
are digital right you don't have to go
like put a gun in somebody's face if you
want to steal something you can steal it
from 3,000 miles away and they never
know who took it
cost microtransactions are really
expensive like imagine right you're in
Korea and you try and take an item
that's worth five cents and trade it
with somebody who's in Britain it's not
possible right when you convert the
currency do the cross-border fees you
don't even get five cents right it's
like negative eight cents right just to
do that so micro transactions we solve
that problem and then fraud so people if
they use
cards or a PayPal account they can
reverse the transaction so then you sell
an item you don't get paid and you don't
have your items so you're unhappy so we
solve these problems we as a platform
absorb all the risk and you know people
like using it now this industry started
I should give you a little bit of
history 1997 right with a game called
Ultima Online and one of our one of our
executive team actually invented that
whole industry and he started selling
them on eBay but eBay said you know what
eventually we don't like virtual items
we don't understand them PayPal decided
to get you know more strict with the
kinds of things they would allow so he
built his own platform and the industry
also evolved and he focused on world of
warcraft who here has heard of world of
warcraft yeah so you have yeah so there
was a stuff called gold and you could
mine the gold which is kind of where the
term of mining Bitcoin I think you know
came from to some degree but regardless
back then you could mined gold people
would trade it and sell it but it had
function and that was the early days and
then csgo created these things that were
completely cosmetic and OPSEC ins our
companies started trading that so we own
absconds this is our company and this is
a like a centralized site right
peer-to-peer market or a marketplace
matching buyers and sellers and then
we've launched something called wax
which is a blockchain based equivalent
now why would you want a blockchain
based equivalent because then people can
trade peer-to-peer and I'll tell you why
that's so powerful but here's the thing
to keep in mind crypto users you know I
don't know I
some people say 30 million wallets I've
seen 15 million active if you look at I
have like 29 crypto wallets so you know
there's a lot of people have a lot of
wallets so I don't know exactly how many
unique people but let's say it's
somewhere between you know 10 and 30
million but you have 400 million PC
gamers and you have 2.3 billion people
who play video games globally so crypto
solves a big problem for app for virtual
item trading that me
that it will probably be the way the
mass market starts using crypto because
it solves problems and there's a lot of
them and they're already used to virtual
items so if I had to bet money I would
bet my Bitcoin that the real first
consumer adoption for crypto will come
from video games and if you look at the
market you'll see you have a hundred
billion dollars spent on video games you
have fifty billion of trading that goes
with with the virtual assets and look
over here you know silver is only a
seventeen billion dollar market and all
of Hollywood is like not even ten so
it's a much it's like ten times larger
than Hollywood and you can see that
people adapt very very quickly and
things are changing really fast so our
marketplace just if you if you don't
know much about market places these are
kind of the things you have to do to
have a have one that works and grows and
so what we did we took all of that and
we said okay we're going to apply it to
essentially a token now we've heard a
lot of businesses that say hey we're
going to tokenize we're gonna go down
that road I have to say this is the
first project I had read I mean
obviously I had wrote the white paper
most of it myself
but as I looked at lots of projects I
couldn't find ones that really really
needed a blockchain solution so this is
the first one and I've looked at
probably hundreds of white papers at
this point and there's just a handful
that I see real applicability and what
we've done is we've said look there's
this whole ecosystem you have to build
to make this thing work so you know
there's a lot to it we're building our
own chain and the protocol itself allows
you to do a lot of things that as you
probably aware if you're paid attention
to these third-generation protocols you
can't do with Bitcoin or aetherium so I
think of you know bitcoin is like
version 1.0 of cryptocurrency it's very
slow very expensive but doesn't have
smart contracts right aetherium version
2.0 has smart contracts but still
and still expensive so now we see third
generation chains that solve the
expensive and slow part but then we're
seeing like a hundred other solutions to
solve other kinds of problems governance
you know permissions security and so
forth
so we're building a third generation
chain we're using Chios as a base and
then we're we're we're forking their
code to have our own version of it so
we'll have our own block producers so it
won't actually be on the the main net
foreo so it'll be our own version
obvious and then we've designed the
token economics and this is for like
kind of the nerds in the room who like
think about this stuff I won't bore you
but we essentially decide just design
the ecosystem so the more it got used
the less tokens would be available and
that is really good for token holders
and if you have questions about it you
can ask me afterwards happy to get into
it but it's really really important I
think to have that in mind because you
know you it's like you're designing an
economy it's very very complicated I
mean just imagine if you had to woke up
if you woke up one day and you're like
well I'm the central bank and I'm the
trade authority and I'm the legal system
and I'm the police I mean there's a lot
to it so I I would have to say I really
believe this is a complicated thing I
don't know if we got it right we'll have
to adjust as we go I think that's true
for probably most token economics now
crypto collectibles this is really the
the main topic of the knives giving you
all this other stuff is sort of
background to understand why NF T's non
fungible tokens are so interesting so
first a definition so fungible just
means that you can trade one thing for
another right so one bitcoins like any
other Bitcoin non fungible means you
can't so anything that's one-of-a-kind
is non fungible so if I'm trading coffee
beans they're fungible because they're
all like each other if I'm trading
pieces of art right they're non fungible
because they're one-of-a-kind so last
year some guys who were
into sort of characters and collectible
things said you know what let's put
something non fungible one-of-a-kind on
the blockchain and let's see what
happens
so the first guys who did it were these
guys built a project called crypto
Punk's nobody really paid attention to
them they actually sold a lot of items
but it didn't really like really catch
people's attention then there was this
project called crypto kiddies who here
are sort of crypto kitties okay all
right so these guys really got
everyone's attention because I think at
about sixty days they had generated over
12 million dollars of revenue which if
you're an indie game developer that is
like that is like heaven times Nirvana
squared right because like to an indie
game developer that's more money but you
could ever imagine
now in the grand scheme of games it
doesn't even show up on the radar
I mean fortnight does that in like three
minutes but but to an indie game
developer it's a big deal and what
happened was they unleashed a flood of
other non fungible token type projects
and they pioneered something a protocol
called ERC 7:21 and you all have heard
of ERC 20 okay so that's just an
ethereal protocol ERC 7:21 is another
aetherium protocol which allows you to
make one-of-a-kind items and all it is
is they take an aetherium block and they
put a piece of metadata in it with a
unique ID which refers to the thing that
is the crypto Kitty that while all the
metadata are out about that crypto kitty
and every single one is different well
by recording it on the blockchain it
means that now everyone can see it
you can now trade it you can now move it
back and forth and there's really no
governance rules because it's governed
just like aetherium like nobody can
really shut it down or stop it that's
huge because most tradable items like
the ones I've talked about the wheat
trade on OP skins are all ultimately
controlled by the game company so if I
say to a gamer hey you can have this
virtual item and nobody can tell you
what to do with it
gamers are pretty interested in that
they like that
so they've unleashed what I think no you
guys probably recognize this person
yeah it's one of my favorite projects as
Kim Jong crypto it's really funny
there's like 95 thousand versions of him
it's like pop art it's like Andy Warhol
meets cryptokeys it's hilarious but
crypto Lambos and crypto alpacas now
most of these collectables will probably
be worthless at the end of the day
because they're not really games they
don't have an ecosystem but it's going
to we're going to see one or two of
these projects really be a breakout hit
and I don't know when could be a year
from now could be two years from now but
we know that it's going to happen and of
course it's unleashed a trend so 12000
da u that's the total number of people
using these decentralized apps today
they're called dabs D and apps daps
crypto kiddies is only about five six
hundred daily active users so it's
actually quite small relative to the
whole ecosystem and most of that 12,000
per day is decentralized exchanges right
like Fork Delta or ether Delta if you're
familiar with that
now the NFT marketplace lots of entrants
have come in saying hey look we want to
trade virtual items so it's I'm really
excited to see the number of people who
have said hey look we want to support
this almost every single one of these
companies is creating more tokenized
assets and we love that now if you will
go to bio crypto kitty just so you
understand it's like ten steps it takes
you could take you half an hour and
it'll probably stop working somewhere
along the way so it's a very complicated
process and so what we did was we put
them on top skins and you can buy them
in just a few seconds you can use a
credit card or PayPal so and it's
instant so we tried to make it easier
and simpler and that's kind of what
we're going for with with the wax token
so we've designed this new blockchain to
make all n FTS instantaneously tradable
so I can talk about the technology
behind it but basically
to understand it simply imagine you have
something like a OS in the middle that
where transactions are instantaneous
they're basically free on your
blockchain and then you have a
connection to every ecosystem of non
fungible tokens whether it's based on a
theory 'm based on you know hash graph
or based on Cardno or anything else you
can wrap those non fungible tokens bring
them into the wax ecosystem and then
trade them back and forth so I can
literally be in aetherium and buy
something that's on hash craft I could
be on iOS and buy something that's built
on Cardno
and the end of course vice-versa so that
ecosystem provides the maximum liquidity
for the most tokens and gives I think
the most opportunity for people who want
to buy sell trade that's where this is
headed and to be honest six months from
now it could be totally different
because six months ago I wasn't talking
about NF T's
we weren't really we didn't really know
that it was gonna be a thing and to be
honest we didn't see that all the other
protocols were ultimately going to
embrace NF T's in the same way so all I
can say is stay tuned because this thing
changes all the time but I'm gonna tell
you one other thing we did a survey with
gamers and we said we asked about a
thousand gamers and we asked them a
bunch of questions about cryptocurrency
and we focused on the ones who already
trade virtual items okay so this is out
of the you know 2.3 billion right
there's like a huge number who already
trade items and this is what they said
75% said they wish they could exchange
their virtual goods into currency so
they could by selling other platforms so
if you don't think that gamers are going
to be the first to adopt crypto I tell
you this statistic like blew my mind
two-thirds of them want more
opportunities more than half of them
already own a crypto some kind and they
all get how powerful it is for
cross-border so we currently support we
have 16 languages
50 different kinds of money so Korean
wons Japanese yen Chinese you know remin
be US dollars etc that we already
support and 90 percent of those
transactions are going between markets
so cross-border is huge so our team you
know we've all built lots of businesses
you know William our CEO was the first
institutional investor in PayPal you
know he's done like two or three hundred
consumer launches Jonathan was the guy
who created item trading so this is like
his like third round
so just incredibly brilliant at this
John lifelong csgo player self-taught
programmer and he said this there's got
to be a better way to trade items on
csgo and he and a bunch of other gamer
buddies built op skins and it was
profitable from the first week we've had
to teach them regression testing but
that's okay there's self-taught
programmer 6o but if any of you know
about like yeah exactly you're like what
but look I can tell you the works
our system does two million transactions
a week it never goes down so you know
whatever but you make it work the guys
on our on our team you know we have some
great advisors Call of Duty creator
who's her knows Call of Duty ecology
Yeah right
Dame Anthony he's like a legend and the
funny thing is about Dave Anthony you
know he's like this very very humble guy
from like Liverpool and he's and he's
like you you hang out with a guy and
you're just like he's like the most
humble guy in the world made like one of
the most amazing games in the world
Brian Fargo you know he's probably no
fallout ken cron probably world of
warcraft I talked about from Vivendi so
we have some really some great great
folks who are working with and then of
course we have some of the best I'm
sorry I skipped over that let me go back
just want to let you know we have some
of the best Wow
they're amazing okay there we go some of
the best participants this should say
hashed scientists your guys do logo so I
apologize you the formal/informal a
black chain partners Korea
okay we'll fix that for you so I
apologize but yeah we've had some great
participants and I think because they
understand where gaming is going and how
it intersects crypto and I we are
actually the first you know a little
known fact we're the first unicorn to do
a token sale you know because we turn
over several billion dollars a table
skins and so at the time you know every
project we were looking at was sort of
like first time building a business or a
first time you know building of
Technology so it's kind of interesting
coming at it from the perspective of a
company that's there's obviously built a
significant it's a significant business
so anyway that's it III hope that was
helpful I have a few minutes for
questions and then we're gonna bring up
some folks in and do a panel and talk
about all right so we can so any
questions okay here so what's the reason
that you're gonna be launching your own
iOS chain instead of just using the main
chain so I didn't get into sort of the
differences in the token ecosystem but
one of the things that drives the token
appreciation is the use of staking and
how you create guilds which are the way
that you decide what items get traded on
the platform so that ecosystem and that
governance requires a different set of
rules than what block producers
currently do so we like delegated proof
of stake we like the speed we like a lot
of the other aspects of VO so we have a
ton of respect for Dan Larimer the
reason why we do our own chain is
because we have other governance
requirements and if you're gonna be
using a variation of staking then won't
you have issues when you first launch
with the total value of the network
being low enough that it won't be too
hard for someone to buy out a
significant portion of an attack it or
something like that so the issues with
sort of initial let's say spoofing of
the system is relatively complex so I
think our initial plan is that it'll be
essentially permissioned in a way that
will allow you know a certain number of
block producers who are fixed and known
to participate until the level of the
network gets to a place where
it's like that risk is reduced so if you
look at like the trip Bitcoin you know
there was obviously it was fraught with
risk at the beginning but nobody really
cared right because it was the there
wasn't any real money at stake with our
system we have hundreds of millions of
dollars at stake so we have to introduce
true decentralization and delegated
proof of stake in a different way one
more question so if you're letting
people buy things with credit cards and
instantaneous and there's an
instantaneous transfer on the blockchain
or something what about transaction
reversibility so a good question we have
pretty sophisticated machine learning
systems that protect us from credit card
fraud and there are now some really
great solutions out there for buying
crypto with credit cards so basically
that crypto acts as the wall between us
and the credit card risk once they've
purchased crypto then the the the seller
of the item is protected because Kryptos
crypto right you can traverse a crypto
transaction so there's kind of two
levels to preventing fraud at the first
level is fiat into crypto and the next
is crypto crypto but I can talk about
more detail sure if you want afterwards
thank you yep other questions okay
okay I run a little cryptocurrency
community called way coin before I came
here I got some questions from Korean
cryptocurrency community who were very
excited and interested about wax and
first question was how is this really
different from steam market and how this
could be how this wax platform can be
safer if steam platform is still
vulnerable it's good question so the
first thing is steam as you know
introduces barriers to trading all the
time there's currently about 16
different restrictions on how you can
trade a csgo item and if you're a gamer
and you've put a lot of time into
earning your items acquiring your items
the last thing you want to do is be
subject to those restrictions so we
really believe that a blockchain based
trading platform where there were you're
not subject to those restrictions is
like night and day and pretty much any
gamer who is frustrated I mean there was
a hundred and fifty thousand signatures
on a petition over the last you know
trade restriction that's that valve
instituted like in the last month that
would be unnecessary it wouldn't happen
so I think that's probably the biggest
you know the biggest draw okay second
question was are you planning to do some
kind of partnership with Korean game
company do you have any plans for that
yeah so I'm here all week so call me
yeah we're talking to lots of lots of
game companies are very very interested
in this new future and if you've noticed
we've we have about 20 or so NFT
projects who are partnered with Hopkins
and and wax that's just the beginning
so obviously were early days we don't
have a pub G or a fortnight like success
in the NFT space but I believe that it
will happen and we'll be there first to
trade ok last question is are there
gonna be some kind of legal legal issue
for going globally for example Diablo 3
had the real currency trading system
right but it didn't really pass in a lot
of countries because it was illegal or
didn't have really proper laws to trade
it like p2p with money
yeah of course how are you going to
dealing with those kind of legal things
or some kind of those things so the
first the first thing to keep in mind is
that the issuer of the item and the
trader of the item in the secondary
market cannot be the same it's very
important if I create an item and I sell
it to you and then I can buy I buy it
back from you I'm now a money
transmitter so that that's you can't do
that I mean you can but it costs a lot
of money and it's a whole new world of
regulation now if the issuer of the item
right is over here and the secondary
market is over here there are two
completely different companies right and
so they don't fall under the money
transmitter rules because the issuer and
the buyer are not the same so it's it's
a subtle but really important difference
from a regulatory standpoint so because
we're not a game company we don't create
the items we don't issue the items we're
in we're all over the world we're
already you know 50 currencies 16
languages you know and when we
introduced Bitcoin we're the largest
e-commerce site in the world in terms of
usage of Bitcoin we added probably
another 30 or 40 markets because they
were markets we couldn't we couldn't
bother with credit cards and all that
kind of stuff is just to calm
located but once we introduce Bitcoin
they're like hey we'll get crypto and
we'll buy skins so they were happy thank
you okay questions before my main
question I want to ask about one thing
what is the exact asset in rats I mean
only came skin or their there could be
various type of SS for games think for
example in gary mode Garry's Mod there
are lots of kinds of things to do to to
to to deal in the game so your question
is what kind of assets are in wax
you mean for trading yeah yeah what well
the SS will be using it Rex
okay so so waxes design is an open
platform so anything that can be
tokenized can be traded thing then it
can be real estate you could trade
anything one of a kind could trade on
wax then some of SS might be very big
like one gigabytes or even ha even
bigger how do you how do you trade them
optimize them yeah okay so here's the
thing about tokenization for anyone here
is you know technical you understand
what a pointer is right but it's it's
like look at it this way a $1 bill
weighs the same as $100 bill right a $1
bill and $100 bill weighs the same
because they represent a different value
but the the thing that's doing the
representation is the same so a token is
a token as a token so whether a token
points to something that's $61,000 right
or 6 cents
or six gigabytes or six kilobytes it
doesn't matter because you're just
moving the token so your token don't
contain the exact data no well think
about it how how big is a private key so
if I have a let's say I have a wallet a
Bitcoin wallet and I have a public and a
private key and a private key points to
a wallet that has one Bitcoin in it or
points a wallet that has a thousand
Bitcoin in it the private key is the
same size so the underlying asset you
use cryptography to control it right but
you don't have to move the underlying
asset you just move the the essentially
the token that controls it okay and yes
there will be very very very big assets
that will get traded we're having
conversations with folks that are
producing incredibly rich beautiful
avatars like lifelike avatars that want
to trade them on the platform those
things will be I don't even know how big
because eventually they'll come with AI
so like here's one idea so imagine you
know you could buy a full replica of
Scarlett Johansson right as a skin and
it's one-of-a-kind
right so that might cost you a hundred
thousand dollars right but then you
might want to get one that actually
comes with all of her language and her
personality and her experiences that's
in an AI and that might cost you a
million dollars so that world is coming
where you'll be able to like buy things
that are really really rich and they'll
be way more than a skin that's you know
20k or 100k but then the underlying
asset won't move it'll just be the token
so I know it's a scary idea right but
it's coming
everyone here seeing ready player one
ready play run yeah so you get it right
like that that's what's going to happen
okay so our next project is the leading
loyalties program in Korea if you've
stopped by restaurant or picked up a cup
of coffee here in Seoul it's highly
likely that you might have interacted
with their platform without even
realizing it they're here to change the
way retail businesses understand and
engage with their customers please
welcome Richard choi co-founder and CEO
of spoken
[Music]
hi my name is Richard I'm the co-founder
and co-ceo of carry our aim is to
connect merchants and customers using
blockchain you know we are all animals
living in the offline world when I wake
up I have to get my cup of coffee I have
to get a sandwich get a haircut meet up
with friends for beer all that happens
so far in the offline world sure the
mobile and online they've been
disrupting this entire world but let me
just put this into perspective Mobile
retail commerce is a six hundred billion
dollar industry online which has been
around for a little bit longer is three
times the size at 1.8 trillion dollars
offline space is 25 trillion dollar
space and this includes all the foods
the haircuts of the beers that you can
get ironically offline space lags behind
the mobile and online and Technology for
example we still use point-of-sales
devices running Windows XP so if
anything this is the largest market
opportunity but there's so much it's
open to disruption the biggest
opportunity is here and right here to
solve real problems in the real world
what we do is we offer a service called
dota points we install tablets on top of
stores on store counters people put in
phone numbers to get points no apps no
download we offer coupon services for
merchants we offer analytics and allow
customers to be friends with cost
merchants on Facebook Kakao or line
it's a super easy solution adopted by
more than ten thousand merchants in
Korea in Japan we started total points
we started spoken seven years ago to
solve merchant problems they have a lot
of needs in the offline world they need
to solve loyalty they need to think of
marketing but at the same time it's the
biggest market for disruption so we
started offering a loyalty service and
it took us a lot of money blood sweat
and tears to come where we are here
today we raised so far to date eleven
million dollars in venture capital from
eight distinguished investors and we
also have partnership with cacao in
Korea we also signed a deal in line last
year in which we co-developed a product
with line and they'll be selling our
products on our behalf Facebook is our
official partner and we are partner
we're an integrated with their ad
services fan pages and messengers we
used to work with small merchants but
now we work with brands that you can all
recognize we've been covered in several
media outlets and we've been lucky
enough to get a few honorable mentions
and awards total point is used by 15
million users in Korea that's one in
three Koreans and company that we
acquired two years ago our comput
competitor also has 5 million users also
we see 130,000 checking activities a day
what that means is people put in their
phone numbers to get loyalty points
130,000 times a day and what this means
is that we know what the purchasing
bought in terms of purchase amounts menu
item and where the person bought it
right we have all those transaction data
and we mapped it to phone numbers we
tracked up to date a billion dollars
worth of offline spending to phone
numbers and with no growth from now we
will still track 2 billion dollars on an
annual basis
so we've been at spoke at the company
operating total we've learned a lot of
real problems and what are they in the
real world basically merchants and
businesses it's very hard for them to
understand their business their
customers to understand their customers
step number of one is gathering data but
all these merchants and stores and
businesses have data silo problem why
because customers don't have a reason to
share information across different
businesses and they're not incentivized
to and because of this they have a hard
time they invest individually duplicate
resources to do this also as I mentioned
in just before customers just don't care
they're not incentivized also they don't
know how their data is being used they
have no visibility and they don't they
have they don't have control after all
they've opted in and what's important is
once the company starts monetizing their
data they're the ones doing heavy
lifting but they don't get a piece of it
and finally whenever you I'm sure you've
all tried ads in the past whenever you
don't ad spending thousands of dollars
you just have to trust them for it for
the report that they gave you at the end
a million views you just have to trust
them for it also this means for the
merchants it's very hard to do targeted
advertising and actually measure the
impact on your revenue so Carrie is here
to solve these problems and to bring
blockchain to the offline world to solve
real problem problems in the real world
we do this by having two token models
first is carry tokens this is our main
token that will be listed on the
exchange and whenever when we're giving
customers an option of sharing their
offline transaction data and every time
they share it Kerry rewards you with a
little bit of Kerry tokens also
advertisers can attach Kerry tokens to
their advertisements so that users are
incentivized to open
and actually care about it and what you
do is these are tokens is that you can
go to visit these offline stores and pay
for everyday things and everyday is
noise second model is branded tokens
this allows branded tokens are issued by
individual merchants or brands for
example Starbucks or Nike or even small
mom-and-pop store selling sandwiches we
allow branded tokens to take features
such as loyalty points coupons or
prepaid cards so I've done enough
talking for now I'd like to show you or
demonstrate exactly how it will work as
a proof-of-concept imagine that you go
into a store wanting to buy a sandwich
with cash and this is a quick
demonstration so you see a tablet facing
you at the store after you've ordered
you can check on what you ordered and
you can put your phone number in to get
loyalty points that's currently similar
to our existing service you get a
confirmation screen facing you and on
your mobile on your iPhone you get a
quick messenger confirmation from
Facebook we are already integrated with
this makes it possible you can log in
and actually check on your facebook
Messenger we'll just transfer you to the
next app carry out so what does happen
is that you paid sandwich with cash
yet we still log that all find
transaction data and in the next slide
my co-founder will explain how it works
and here's the highlight we enable
people to set their privacy
this is actually something that does not
exist now and what the great thing is
that if I'm someone who's very sensitive
about my data I can choose to not share
anything but also not get anything in
return
or maybe I'm so very interested in
opening my behavior my data and getting
very relevant rewards and a lot of them
in which case I can press hi so I'm kind
of in-between so I'm gonna just press a
medium just press it on and look already
I actually actually have a coupon
waiting for me based on my purchase
history and it's a Kevin's Coffee nearby
so I'm gonna just press my alerts and
press the coffee and look I get a coupon
so we carry token is actually very
important we think that a lot of
advertisers will attach three tokens to
their advertisements to entice people to
open them more and we think that that
will drive a lot of the token demand
going forward so what just happened is
that you decided to you can set your
privacy settings and and set how much of
your data you actually want to disclose
to act or make it accessible to
merchants or third-party advertisers and
these carry tokens that you get you can
just use them to make everyday payments
now imagine that you've been getting
coupons and advertisements for a while
and you've been sharing your data you
must have collected you know a few carry
tokens now what can you do with these
carry tokens I'll show you how
walkthrough how easy it is to actually
make payments with carry tokens in the
real world so again you'll walk into a
Kevin coffee you just got a coupon from
there and again you'll see of a customer
facing tablet and you put your phone
number in there to claim your claim your
coupons and right on the spot it'll give
you an option of what method would you
like to use and you know you can use
Bitcoin ether but at the same time let's
say for this purpose you want to use
carrying you can put your PIN code we
can implement a two-factor
authentication
and voila that's it that's how easy it
is to be able to use crypto in the real
world so what just happened here we did
three things regardless of your payment
options whether you pay with the Fiat or
whether you pay with cash credit card or
crypto with users consent with their
buy-in we're logging their offline data
number two they do this because they're
now directly in control they have their
ownership of data they can monetize it
by making it accessible or not
monetizing it and keeping it to myself
which we think is extremely important so
very high-level view of the summary and
I'm done here for the consumer they can
just buy a cup of coffee sandwich using
cash credit card and get rewards like
you used to by interacting with our
tablet and if they choose to share this
data then they'll be rewarded with carry
tokens carry protocol will reward them
with carry tokens from the merchants
perspective if you want to advertise a
cupcake for example you can use care as
merchants can use carry to from promote
your deals in a form of branded tokens
and you can also attach carry tokens to
people who fit in your profile and give
the brenda tokens out with the carry
tokens which can be used almost like
cash in everyday situations so we are
here to solve real-world problems in the
real world and we believe that you know
solving the offline problem is a massive
opportunity we start with 10,000 stores
in in Korea and Japan or our aim we have
a big goal is to introduce blockchain to
the rest of the world our goal over
three years is getting into 500,000
stores and eventually reaching to 300
million users 20 times our existing user
base we also want to increase expand our
utility of a branded token
from just loyalty coupons and prepaid
cards down to financing such as
crowdsourcing of crowdfunding of stores
and also Ted financing I'll be here all
evening if you have any questions feel
free to come up to me and ask me
questions thank you
[Applause]
okay so that actually will doesn't wrap
it up we actually have a one last
special guest here you guys all heard of
this project it's called Definity we
have Dominic Williams who is the chief
scientist there I think it's his first
time in Korea so he's a little bit
hungover from last night we had a little
too much fun so go easy on him but he's
going to be just explaining at a high
level what he's working on and some of
the problems he can be solving here
Thank You Dominic thank you Alex and you
know thank you for organizing this
conference and inviting me and thank you
for reminding everyone that I'm a bit
hungover so to make it more difficult
for myself I'm gonna just sort of a
cappella talk on why I think
decentralisation is valuable and
specifically try and give some pointers
to how you can generate value from this
kind of technology
so before I start with that briefly
introduced affinity in case you haven't
heard of it
Definity is developing what we call the
internet computer so that's a I got a
blockchain supercomputer that our
mission is to host the next generation
of the world's software and data on this
slide here you can see I kind of
photograph taken in the Palo Alto
Research Lab a few weeks back and
Definity test network it's a kind of
interesting thing things I test now is
graph 400 nodes but what we're able to
do is combine computers distributed
around the internet to create a single
supercomputer the world can share and
that has
provides you know all of the properties
you'd expect from a blockchain to the
software that runs on it software can be
written in a thing called web assembly
or that's a web assembly virtual machine
so you can write the software and
variety of languages and it has some
special properties it's very fast will
produce finality in a couple of seconds
even though it uses a probabilistic
protocols has very resistant to attack
and of course as you probably guess from
the name Definity it's designed to scale
out as capacity as necessary
because there's a lot of software and
data in the world anyway you know I've
been in this industry for a long time
actually the Definity project came out
of another project that I worked on
through 2014 trying to speed up
blockchain protocols by repurposing
traditional consensus protocols and
beginning of 2015 I had to abandon all
that work I found a different way of
doing things and yeah so defenders been
cooking since early early 2015 so you
know in that time I've had a lot of you
know I've met a lot of people and fought
a lot about network protocols and also
applications that can run on top of
these protocols and it actually in
Silicon Valley there's really big focus
on a thing called product market fit and
product market fit refers to the ability
of a product or service or indeed a
decentralized platform to meet the needs
of users and deliver value in some way
that persuades people to use your
service or product so I want to go on a
sort of a lightening tour of
decentralized value starting with the
protocol itself what's valuable in a
decentralized protocol so
for us when we design the definitive
Network we are very keen that the nodes
in the network will equal and that you
know even if we have as our ambition
stands you know fifty to a hundred
million computers in the network each of
those millions of computers in the
network plays a completely equal role so
there are no single points of failure
and the reason for that is it makes the
platform more robust so the objective of
the internet computer is to host the
next generation of the world's software
and data and today the whole world runs
on software so imagine if we succeeded
and the whole world did start building
on divinity and then the Definity
network the internet computers stopped
working be a catastrophe right so we
have to design a protocol that doesn't
depend upon a small number of special
computers right and this is one of the
ways that we deliver value we create a
symmetric network that is extremely
robust I think the reason this is
pertinent to think about today is that a
lot of networks have a different design
they've forgotten what decentralization
means decentralization was invented by
the designers of the internet to credit
communications network that would
continue to function in the event of a
nuclear war even if there was a nuclear
war they wanted people to be able to
continue communicating so the internet
was designed with packet switching such
that and no central points of control
such that you know data could be routed
across any functional
path in the network and you know since
now is a huge success we'll come back to
some other properties of the internet
and decentralisation that made that
possible but certainly when you're
designing a network protocol and when
you're looking for a network protocol to
build on you should be looking for real
to centralization this industry is about
creating systems that are unstoppable
partly and extremely robust so it
shouldn't be the case if someone's
proposing a decentralized compute
platform that it actually depends on a
small number of computers and there are
quite a few big projects out there today
that depend upon a very small number of
special computers and you have to ask
yourself you know would the world want
to build on top of those networks when
if a small number of computers fail
every system on top of that network
fails - doesn't sound very likely to me
anyway that's kind of protocol that
stuff there was another reason the
internet succeeded so back in the 1990's
there was the internet which was an open
protocol an open network and there were
also private networks so in America you
had America online you had CompuServe
back in the nineteen nineties I was in
the UK and British Telecom wanted to
create this thing called the information
superhighway and they said to the
government hey the Internet's gonna be
very dangerous
it's permissionless anybody can create a
service on the Internet
right this is really bad anybody can
create a service on the Internet we
suggest that British Telecom creates the
information superhighway and we'll kind
of connect everybody to a walled garden
and we'll carefully curate all the
content right now
these Private Networks didn't succeed
overwhelmingly
the world chose to build on the Internet
and there are a number of things about
an open protocol right so first of all
because the Internet is based on tcp/ip
and open protocol people could
independently extend it so if you went
back to the 1990s there were in the UK
hundreds of Internet service providers
all of whom were independently
connecting to the Internet to extend it
that was one reason has succeeded it
could scale out very fast but the other
reason was that nobody needed permission
to connect to the internet right now
imagine the difference imagine in 1996
or 97 you're an entrepreneur and you
wanted to create an online service what
are you gonna do you're gonna get them
go to America online I mean some people
did do a deal with them so that your
special service is available to American
lines users or are you gonna connect to
the internet now originally of course
probably America Online have more users
but the thing is this if you built on
America Online or CompuServe or the
information superhighway had it come
into being your existence would depend
on the goodwill of the private network
operator so you know you might start off
create some service on America Online
and over time America online might
decide that they want to create their
own version of your service right what's
going to happen America Online controls
the network but they've decided that
they want to run the same service is
there going to be a level playing field
have you got just as much right to
provide a service on America Online as
America Online has of course you haven't
you haven't it's not an open environment
it's a private closed environment so the
beauty of the Internet was because it
was a truly open protocol firstly it
could be built out very quickly and in
in in the UK where I came from there
were hundreds of ISPs that extended the
internet so that everybody could connect
but also it was possible for innovation
to flourish like entrepreneurs flocked
to the internet because they didn't need
permission and they could provide a
service over the internet that nobody
could turn off and that was a completely
different proposition to connecting a
service to a private network like
America online of CompuServe or British
telecoms thing that's why the internet
took offering that we had the dot-com
boom and there was this explosion in
innovation so the openness of platforms
is absolutely critical and that's
another thing that you need to think
about if you look at a decentralized
network and you're thinking of building
on top of it well of course you should
look at the decentralisation because if
the protocols more decentralized it's
more robust it's more likely to be
reliable and support your service better
but you also need to look at how that
networks run is it really a consortium
is it really controlled by business
interests because if it's really
controlled with business interests and
you build your service on this network
and then somebody else builds a
competitive service and the owners the
consortium the people behind that
network invest in your competitor what's
gonna happen to you right mysterious
things might happen all kinds of things
can happen and that I think will emerge
but you need to look at the openness of
networks okay so let's think about
building
DAB's let's assume that we found a you
know a genuinely decentralized network
that's high-performance and scalable and
it's open and there's no chance it's a
level playing field right how can we
build gaps that are valuable so these
are the last two things in my time here
on stage that I'm gonna run past you
so I'm the the first thing is a thing
called platform risk and this actually
is applies kind of like as a adjunct to
what I was just describing in Silicon
Valley the model has been to create for
a long time to create monopolies so what
happens is you have a new field of
business like p2p ride-sharing and you
know initially there's a whole bunch of
different competitors and for example
that p2p ride-sharing you had like uber
lyft sidecar there are a whole lot of
other ones I can't remember now and the
sort of forgotten and you know
originally all of these different
ride-sharing companies got funding and
then over time you know what as winners
you know leaders emerge capital is then
sort of poured into the leader with the
aim of creating a monopoly because once
you've created a monopoly you can
absolutely mint money and that's
happened in every sector you know
Facebook Google you name it
so the Silicon Valley model really has
been today to create monopolies and I'll
give you some examples of why that
creates a very hostile environment for
entrepreneurs and this is the thing that
we can fix on platforms like the
internet computer and other
decentralized platforms great example of
platform risk was provided by zinger
who's heard of zinger the game's company
that zinger was a company in San
Francisco that invented a game called
farmville I figured how many uses
farmville had it it
it was a social game so I ran on top of
Facebook and I think he got a hundred
million users or something crazy and it
grew very fast and Zynga was seen as an
extremely successful company
unfortunately and well they were doing
very well they ran an ICO they had a
multibillion-dollar cap everything was
going swimmingly and then one day
Mark Zuckerberg decided to change the
rules on Facebook that governed how
social games could promote themselves
right so poor ol Mark Pincus this guy at
the zinger woke up and he just suddenly
discovered that the rules on Facebook
had changed and this fundamentally
undermined the ability of zinger to
promote their games and you know things
weren't nearly so rosy for them after
Facebook changed the rules I knew a
company in Palo Alto that was a unicorn
and the one sort of difficulty they had
was that they relied upon the profile
data from LinkedIn so their product
needed the profile data from LinkedIn
they didn't see the threat but
unfortunately in 2015 LinkedIn decided
that the only people that could access
that profile data well the only
companies were going to be Microsoft and
Salesforce so anyways this company ended
up having to sell itself to Salesforce
after losing 75 percent of its value
this is what's known as platform risk
now the reason I'm describing that is
one of the greatest ways that these
platforms can add value is by enabling
us to reinvent Internet services in the
form of open source businesses using
autonomous software so what that means
is you know you can reinvent you know a
business network like LinkedIn using
software that has an in
governance system that is used to update
it so as you probably are aware from you
know theorem smart contracts these
platforms support something called
autonomous software autonomous software
exists independently independently of a
company or a person that's its power so
you can create an internet service using
autonomous software and you can tokenize
it and this software needs to have an
inbuilt governance system that is
ultimately controlled by the token
holders and this can you know adopt
software software updates which can be
collected from the community right so
what we're doing is you know we've
already got open source software but
we're creating a business an internet
service that's also open source now the
actual operation itself the service
itself is of open source right and in
the design of the autonomous software
that creates the open LinkedIn there has
no company or person behind it you can
provide guarantees about how people will
be you know granted access to the
profile data and the reason this is
important is it provides you a way of
de-risking the proposition for other
entrepreneurs that want to build on top
of your system
right and this is why eventually I don't
know how long it's going to take but you
know things like adapt on the internet
computer will Internet services running
on the internet computer what will
explode because people can re-engineer
Internet services in open source form
and these open source versions of
Internet services can provide people
other other other entrepreneurs and
other systems with much much better
guarantees about for example the
availability
of api's you know for example the
LinkedIn profile data right so now think
about this imagine you're a young
entrepreneur and you see the traditional
centralized centralized monopolistic
internet right and then you look at
these decentralized computation
platforms where the internet services
are open source businesses right and you
can build against their api's with
guarantees that they won't be taken away
which would you choose to build on you
choose to build on the open platform
because there's no chance you're getting
rid of your platform risk there's no
chance that your use of those API is
your access to those API is going to be
taken away from you so what this will
lead to is a kind of mutual eyes Network
effect right currently on today's
monopolistic internet the aim is to
create an Internet service that reaches
sufficient scale that it can establish
network effects and become a monopoly
that nobody can compete with because
they've established a monopolistic
position right but the network effects
are limited to the monopoly to the
single monopoly and the great
opportunity here is to create a new
internet which is decentralized using
autonomous software to build open source
Internet services that provide each
other with guarantees about how you can
access their data and api's and
therefore you know this open Internet
this open decentralized Internet will
the participants will benefit from
mutual eyes network effects right if you
have the open LinkedIn and it
and it is succeeding because it's
established Network effects and
everybody wants to be on it well guess
what now those other interesting
services that extend the decentralize
LinkedIn they can benefit from its
network effects because they can access
API is without risk they'll be taken
away and likewise the LinkedIn service
can benefit from all these other
services innovators and entrepreneurs
are adding on top so anyway
yeah that's it it's a big topic you know
there's lots of ways that you can add
value in this space but I think
considering openness and the value of
openness is absolutely essential to the
planning for any decentralized service
whether that and that runs right away
from selecting the network that you want
to build on top of through to designing
your own architecture and thinking about
how you can provide guarantees for other
entrepreneurs who might want to build on
your service anyway that's it thanks
[Applause]
you
sorry buddy macGruber opening our movers
ocean and a IOT change Laden project
wheel the summer Internet CEO and
blockchain are you teaching how you
could do I have to Cheney will o reason
once a lot you can i UT web an issue in
and then you thought okay case on how
locks in row so so yet a tumult Reese
Wynans delusional chocolate see IOT
Cheney co-founder in Peters area booster
rockets American box with dr. Cassandra
alright it's quite honored to be here to
introduce our project alga chain to you
and it sucks for hashed and the home pro
to prepare this great place and just to
let me introduce our project to you and
I how to say sorry because you have to
okay now how to say story first because
you how to endure my poor English & Gumi
if I need some help for my friends okay
and let me introduce myself and
co-founder of lt-gen and our CEO Niro is
also here today and when he found me
last to your much I was in show me the
Chinese cell phone company I was in
charge of the Xiaomi blockchain group
those times we use a blockchain to
solving the data sharing problem and
when I folded and blockchain could bring
lots of value to out industry I decided
to leave
show me and started this project with
hours in you narrow okay and we think
that the future is the Food Authority is
made up by royalty our life will
strongly the wheel LT devices like the
robots the first approach activation our
life may follow all kaizo robots from
very smoke up to a big house all the
devices neither OS to connect to the
internet and this is gross compares from
PC a mobile phone and Audi devices we
can fall to that we can fight it on to
the personal computer has been the
history and the peat under the mobile
phones is the course a mobile phone also
slows down the mobile Internet is not
growing data fast as before part of the
IOT devices the out industry it's still
growing very fast very rapidly and by
1301 among the whole words 28 billion
connected devices there will be 60
billion of them will be out devices so
the IOT industry will be the future and
it's the market cap when in 2021 there
will be two hundred and fifty three
billion USD market cap and we believe
that to the filter society is LT is made
up by LT devices your life is certainly
the peyote devices when you are driving
to home and your air condition will
start work for you before you come to
whom under your camera know what's
happening your home and the LT devices
know where you are what are you doing
LT will make our life much
more convenient much more intelligent
but at the same time the safety problem
is more in the most areas for example
the Mira virus
it turned thousands of devices into
controlled robots with this control the
robots the hacker could start network
attack Lakha DDoS the virus that time
that he does he does the DNS server of
Twitter that time the Twitter is broken
down by the Miro virus and the other
safety problem is the teacher safety you
know the all your data is collected by
the LT devices they know everything and
it's and if the data is not prepared
prepared well and if the hacker know if
you are home if you are at home they
will have tasks to do many persons that
so we can't accept so we can say we can
fight it on to the there are two tangos
we can conclude that one is the safety
problem because the traditional LT
architecture the devices are connected
to a centralized the server your your
devices your smart devices are
controlled by the center of the server
let me take her example just to some
days happen to e channel a user bought a
camera from China company it's also a
Gnostic common e360 and after he bought
a camera the camera is opened by the
server and he his life become a live
show
it's very horrible ironically the answer
the company is a safety company so the
control right of the device is the first
safety problem the second safety problem
is that the data problem I just
mentioned and in our architecture we use
blockchain to build a decentralized
network there's no central servers and
your T your your device is controlled by
the authorized your server for like only
the authorized cellphone could control
your device and we adopted the metric
increased and a semi homomorphic
encryption so that's our data can be
protected so in lt-gen way men they
solve this to cadeau safety problem and
the second challenge is the high cost
you know what manufacturer when a
company he wants he sells out his
product he sells his smarts product and
with the amount of the product he sells
he had to pay more cost to maintain the
server cost you know that in China this
smart this companies small companies
they have to pay a lot to ally green or
observe or by doing because he had to
afford they have to afford as a server
cast in blockchain architecture it's
pretty interesting because the company
who sells the the company who sells a
devices they how I don't how to consider
about the storage cost or the server
cost in the network the witness note
or the other note who afford who prevail
who provided the server or storage this
note they will afford to the storage and
the server because they could get a
transaction fees and those transactions
are generated from the common user not
from the company's manufacturers who
sells who sells product to user so it's
very interesting
so a blockchain architecture the cost of
all those companies or manufacturers is
very low so we can follow that we can
finance there are two authorities
blockchain losses could could bring one
is the high security the other is low
cost and when we adapt to the
traditional blockchain technology into
out industry we fall there are Street
for challenges we are facing the first
is the resource consumption you know the
traditional option like Bitcoin or SRM
as you have the computing tasks for each
node is pretty pretty high and lt
devices you only have low computing
ability and the second problem is the
theta expression you know the blockchain
in bit corny or is room even you want to
start a client in your personal computer
you how to down many many data before
you could start a transaction the second
the third problem is the performance you
know when we're talking about
performance there are two numbers we
want to we want to tell what is the GPS
transaction for
second the other number is the the other
number is the conformist in time you
know in bitcoins that come from recent
time is ten minutes and in use as real
the confirmation time is 12 minutes
no 12 seconds this performance is not
suitable it's not suitable to alt
industry and the last challenge we are
facing is the producing terrorists in
our industry the devices could be online
or could it be offline very quickly very
very frequently this will generate a
network of socks
and I'll teach an architecture way use
these basic concepts use this basic
technology to solve some problems and
our consensus architecture is SVP of T
there's a planarian to some well some
people may think that TB of T is only
suitable to permissioned production
because that is because the pbft
algorithm there will when a return of
vote there will be there will be
multiple zones of online communication
to make each vote so the bottleneck for
pbft algorithm is the white is the band
whites but we have found that there are
some new algorithm how coming out like
hash graph in the new pbft algorithm the
bottleneck for kind of whites is no more
it's no more the challenge and we use
simple payment verification which is a
pretty common in a pity corner
and the other blockchain project and our
and our production data structure is deg
it's a block last structure in which the
transaction just into the whole order
without the process of block generating
it's not like the Bitcoin or Israel and
the the last two CPS is much about to
modulate this we divided the
architecture of our blockchain into some
parts like the consensus apart the
consensus part the structure the detox
has a constructor part and and there's a
smart contract machine part so by proper
module resistance the architecture could
be adapted into more situation
performance analysis for some other
house and we focus on two numbers which
is GPS and the other is the the other is
the confirmation time in lt-gen we our
goal of speed about reaching our goal of
confirmation time is millisecond and as
I said someone maybe think that is a 50
in PFT always of the nodes who
participates in the consensus is limited
but a new algorithm like hash graph or
like our SBB ft the nodes who can know
the amount of nodes who participated to
buildings the other the algorithm
is more than 100 so the so it's not
correct they're saying pbft is only
suitable for permission alized the
public change it's also suitable to
public blockchain and we have we have
extract the two parts which the cheap
the modules who do why is the what is
the identity to each LT device that's
something like as a private key public
key and the address that's also the same
as its core know is wrong the other is
the data processing you have to the chip
the smart device how to signing the data
encryption theta or uploading the data
so there will be two parts with the chip
the module the module take part one is
the additi the other is the data
processing
so our OS could be adapted in to the
very low computing devices and how to
how that how to a common device in
become device in our network will adapt
our chip into a common equipment and
then the device has the ability to
interact to the blockchain network and
if you need you could use our mobile app
to interact with the device and our CEO
narrow he runs a company for four years
is a traditional LT company what that
company did what L are commonly do is
that to a normal device
when it is integrated with the Mojo that
company created the device could be
changed to a smart device and what we
are doing now is that besides the
besides the traditional module focus on
the smart focus on the turn a common
device to smart device and we add the
blockchain part which I mentioned is a
two part into the into the chip and when
the chip is integrated into a common
device the device could be enjoying the
benefits the blockchain reason and this
here's some competitiveness about
teaching and to other project like alta
like locate the most frequently question
is that what's difference between LTTE
and out I think I'll make a standard API
to make a standard API so that common
device factories common device
manufacturers there could adopt that to
attempted to that API but you need hire
some production engineer but the the
soldier caster is pretty high in our
plan we just do this work into cheap so
the device communists they just adapted
our chip into their device so the device
could in could be integrated in our
network and one more thing is that we
think the out is not that not to
terrorise enough you know out the
validator validator notes out our code
that part has not been open sourced and
MIT do some
experiment and the FIDE they do can the
thought of that is not centralized
envelope check if you are not sterilized
if you are not it is analyzed that means
you are not as safe enough finally his
our it's our team member
our say you'll they're also here and me
and our CTU has a lots of experienced a
hardware and our staff will it's very
professional and our team member are
mainly from Chinese internet company
like I do like Ali Baba like show me
that's all the Akshay IOT chain violence
or immunization with the so introduced
America Mike Haddad is summed up any
questions
okay there's one thank you for the
presentation
what is the next development of your
project what is what stage or do we have
a complete detail structure that is a
huge part the next work way how to do is
to make as a network be real they
centralize the network that's a SP BFG
part so our major task we are doing now
is to make this network
PT's realized enough yeah thank you the
terrible human is Sushma got other
questions you want to ask
io2 chain Thank You ambassador Chris
[Applause]
thank you hello everyone my name is
Anunnaki and I'm a product marketing
lead at infinity blockchain laughs so
I'm a product marketing lead of infinity
over infinity blockchain labs and we are
the little blockchain ecosystem in the
Nam and today I'm very honored to be
here to take you through the landscape
of been on blockchain industry in so
this slice of slide it will cover how it
looked like and then what is the
potential out there and who are the
major ecosystem players so clock chiming
numbers okay if you look at this slide
in general we already know what is the
potential blockchain so as we said here
total currency market cap whether the
market value has been increased from 18
billion to 500 billion within a year why
why it is keep increasing because of
definitely is pretty much of Bitcoin and
cryptocurrency growth however I see
however I think you know it's not only
because of Bitcoin what ethereum but
also we see in moist technology and
applications so how these technology can
bring how can these technologies can
swing into different industries and then
bring new opportunities and products to
the market so this is slide actually we
have been statistically reconciled on
the left-hand side if you look at it the
same time the bank has identified 20 to
25 use cases for the blockchain
technology and also on the bottom you
see that the bottom government seriously
began taking a proactive approach so
actually most people are asking me I
mean some people they're really asking
me whether Benham government whether
they banned in blockchain and it up
locked in or something but definitely
it's not because they just bent it for
the method of payment for example if I
want to buy the shoes and then if I make
a payment for with the cryptocurrency
then is illegal however been on
government they have a clear picture of
what is the difference between
currency and also blockchain so for the
blockchain itself government is very
supportive so sorry it's very supportive
so the right hand side are so far we
have 48 FinTech firms in Vietnam of
course it's representing a pretty small
percentage of the startups so in this
page the key message is the key message
that I want to highlight is how much
banks I'm vesting in blockchain
solutions is 91% so it was quite
optimistic isn't it okay so actually my
company we've been in this space for two
years since 2015 so at that time
actually there was nothing there was
nothing about ecosystem nothing about
blockchain but there of course you know
there are a lot of ecosystem players
interest interest from a lot of
ecosystem players are increasing and
there are kind of you know there are
several activities around ecosystem
players incomes of events so let's just
have a look at what kind of event we had
it so in here let's have a look at the
right-hand side of admin blockchain
hackathon actually this was arranged by
my company so that's why I have to say
it first yeah because I'm working for
infinity doctrine laughs and then the
next one is that of tech fest 2017 and
this is national technologies fair by
government and then Asolo I think
Zala is like let's say that they're like
a whatsapp or Kakao Talk in Vietnam so
they have a huge social media platform
and they arranged as aloha cotton to
highlight blockchain then in 2018 as
just you know he just mentioned it we
had a patent I mean but non blockchain
week last two weeks ago and then we had
over 2,000 delegates from the reason and
then we highlight the blockchain and
then we were talking about what is the
potential and it was quite successful
because I mean in Vietnam I mean what
kind of you know event can have over
2,000 delegates so it was very uh
successful event so let's have a look at
the blockchain ecosystem players
am i speaking too fast no ok so
blockchain and echo system players let's
just say have a little how many I'm not
gonna talking about how many ecosystem
players we have however I'm gonna tell
you you know what are the startup
companies and what other organizations
we have so for example here the
blockchain startup on the right hand
side I think Bitcoin that is the first
Bitcoin exchange in Vietnam and then
let's have a look
so kyvan network I'm sure the khyber
network is very familiar with the Korean
community isn't it I think the last time
they was here to present about the
project and those kind of stuff so
clever Network actually they are there
they want to build decentralized
exchange and then what else so the claim
is that the financial service on the
blockchain and definitely we have in
people blockchain our Infinity
blockchain labs which is R&T and we are
providing the ecosystem so these are the
blockchain startup however are these are
these most of companies they registrated
in abode but their in-house are there
are developers their in-house developers
they are based in Vietnam so in this
page we have like no training no Jewish
organizations supporting organizations
in general startup companies I'm sure
that we have like several startup
companies from Vietnam here most of
startup companies they cannot be
standalone they cannot be stand or not
because they need a lot of support from
other organizations such as training
training supporting organizations and
also exchange platform because they need
they can't really be standalone and then
other companies for example TMI TMI TMI
is that the second biggest IT company in
Vietnam and also there is a novice
novices national payment corporation and
both of them they are kind of
international company but they but they
are like you know there with outsourcing
services but they want to
and they want to have some blockchain
project from their side
okay and from here actually I want to
share some of the the result of survey
from our side we do some survey on a
regular basis and then we divide it by
two groups
so first group is the the 30 companies
among non blockchain companies and also
blockchain companies which is like you
know startups and incubators media and
their regulators so let's see how they
look at the market what is their main
concern so this is that the survey this
is the reason why we are doing the
survey but definitely in Vietnam we are
the lead of R&D and then we need to
provide a helicopter of you blockchain
ecosystem in Vietnam and of course we
need to see the what is the potential
and also what is that a future suspected
perspective or blockchain among major
other local players and we need to see
who are those kind of players and then
how we can really support for other
players so profile of collaborators so
in our survey we were searching we was
kind of like you know something like
what is their business nature and then
what is the funding size and how many
steps they have and also how long
they've been in this market so if you
look at this chart you can already see
that most majority of people they are
letting the business of technology and
then the funding size is less than 1
million and they have generally they
have less than 50 people and then they
are in the market around run 2 years 2
years is like you know really average
year because I mean normally I travel
around and then when I go to the event I
do a lot of Meetup and then when I'm
made a lot of like startup companies and
then we always ask me hey how long you
been in the napkin and then they say ok
6 months 1 year and then if someone say
oh I've been in this blockchain industry
like 10 years then we would normally say
your grandfather because normally is 2
years or 3 years but some of companies
even they're in the market like over 10
years or five years still they need a
lot of support because they cannot be
standalone
so this page what is the major concern
what are the expectations for blotching
trust trust problem they want us to the
expectation for blockchain is a trust
actually it's not really not nothing
really new because from the website I
mean from the Google wherever good
newspaper they always talking about the
trust for room and then cost efficiency
so in Vietnam still is the same
expectation for blockchain is trust
problem and then cost efficiency and
then let's look at that the challenge
regarding blockchain adoption in Vietnam
but before that on the left-hand side
83% of finance company in financial
service they want to study more about
blockchain they want to adopt blockchain
and so that's why you know they are the
most active segment
want to follow up with blockchain
technology and then the next one is a
supply chain supply chain domain and
then the third one is the public service
including government and then the
right-hand side this part is very fun
part because everyone is really
concerning about the regulation isn't it
so same is same as in banana the key
challenge and that the main concern is
that the regulation because at this
moment we did not have any specific
regulation there is no conflict
regulation framework so government they
still trying to study and then trying to
reconcile what is the what they gonna do
with this regulation so at this moment
we are kind of waiting until they really
announce what they gonna do with it so
but I think in the same as other
countries still I mean regulation will
be the the main issue and here adoption
plan we asked to the blockchain
companies that whether they have in any
adoption plan you know and then the
majority of people like to over seventy
percent of people say that okay yeah
definitely why not I mean
I really want to do business with this
kind of technology so it's still very
optimistic so that was the first survey
the first group with non blockchain
companies and blockchain companies and
from here the survey was only with
blockchain companies and those are like
you know 12 companies but however the
result compared with the first one and
then the second one is very similar so
I'm not going to go through like a ones
one by one but let me just show you very
quickly so here our engagement with the
blockchain we've been so basically they
want to do some business and then
they're actually doing business and
applications by using a blockchain but I
don't know whether they have a really
actual product or actual they can really
provide any services but they're still
doing business and application on
blockchain so that is like 50 percent
and then then from here it's nothing I
think you know from first slides I let
it cover that you know that the trust
cost problem and also like you know they
either in the finance service so as I
say the first result and the second
result is pretty much the same so here
we've asked like a future first actually
this is the future perspective about
blockchain with ask like you know what
do you think about the blockchain
movement in Vietnam in the future and
then they say normally they say might
take more than three years for
blockchain to thrive or I think
blockchain will quickly thrive in Nexus
three years or less so three years is a
really long time or a short time I'm not
really sure however we think that you
know once the government Vietnamese
government they really you know set up
their the the regulation and then we can
really speed up I hope I mean I don't
know like you know we really hope that
you know come on man can really do
something with it and then we can really
speed up for this kind of this
movement so the recommendations these
are the recommendations that we these
are the recommendations that we have for
blockchain ecosystem players so first
what is the main thing
block chain dedication so education is a
first if you do not know what is
blockchain if you do not know what to do
with it then I think there is no value
so from outside we always think that
education is to the first main thing and
then second the regulator resent us so I
think as some of you guys already know
in Singapore they are they're running
they're kind of in the middle processing
do some like you know trial and test on
the regulation blockchain regulation
side but as I say before
No no other no no no come I mean country
have a can click framework of regulation
but they still doing the the trial and
I'm not gonna say trial and error but
I'm gonna say trial and pest so that is
you know what I'm talking about that
sandbox they need to do some like you
know testing and that they need to see
the seemed to do some simulation and
they need to do some demonstration and
then they need to see how they can
really play with it so that is that the
sandbox and then from here let's just
say that from now on
in general we do not talk about
blockchain anymore I mean because
everyone knows about the blockchain
potential and then we know what it is so
now we are not really talking about
blockchain in general what we talk about
it we now we are more talking about
actual application how we can apply this
blockchain in different in different
industry or in different product so it's
more like actual actual technology so
now yeah and then the last key message
they should say that the last key
message so the blockchain is
in here is a embarrassing blossom
bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-bah but let's just
say this way whether you like it or not
within three years blockchain is the
thing that you cannot you cannot really
avoidable because from now on within two
to three years everyone gonna talk about
blockchain most of your competitors if
you are doing your own business your
competitors they're gonna let it do some
business with blockchain it's gonna be
like in a national race so if you do not
know what to do with it if you do not
know how to apply it into your product
and services then what things gonna
happen it's up to you so I think you
know the blockchain you need to know it
adapt it and then you need to think what
is the really value and then of course
we need to think about how we can
leverage this blockchain to the actual
value why it's so quiet here I'm like
too good on too bad okay so here since
I'm from Vietnam so let me just talk
about my company a little bit so I'm
from the infinity blockchain laughs and
then we are the leading blockchain R&D
company so now he's saying that our over
150 however actually we have more we
have around 200 200 200 in-house
engineers marketers and the projectile
actors and etc so basically we are we
are providing the the business as a
service to business business partners
and that we have we have like a new
cryptocurrency wallet and then we are
providing identify for vacation platform
and so on of course we are in Vietnam I
mean we are the blockchain space in
Vietnam for like two to three years
however we are more like active and
globally not only inventor so the next
of course I was talking about my company
then what do I have to talk about talk
about me yeah so as I say my name is a
little key and then I'm head of
the marketing lead so what I do every
day what I do so very skinny I'm in
charge of infinite or ecosystem service
service and solutions including the
wallet blockchain API services I see
ourselves platform kyc AML operations so
this is all about me but I hope you guys
really enjoy this session and I hope
this really helpful yeah and this is all
thank you very much for listening
any questions go ahead you said that the
payment in currency is available in
Vietnam not available yeah so for
example if you want to buy the shoes and
then you want to pay by critic if you
want to pick your want to buy shoes and
then if you want to make a payment with
your cryptocurrency then no it's illegal
what about I see you I see I spent this
so actually most of companies they moved
to another company another country like
a Singapore or Switzerland Zipporah
thought because they're more like you
know I feel friendly and yeah that's why
they just do some I see you in another
country instead of an now it's kind of
now they say okay yes no maybe
but if you don't know do I see oh if if
the regulation or if the restriction is
like yes no maybe do you want to do it
no so that's why they move to another
country with more like which is more
friendly to I see you and blocking that
it's about blockchain or cryptocurrency
because I've heard about Swiss and Japan
that they made a law about law ok the
legal framework yeah but as I say in
Vietnam at this moment there's no legal
framework and then they're still working
on it
because
yeah at this moment we did not have so
and then as you say you know there are a
lot of rumors yeah we are hearing a lot
of rumors every day we are like cooling
and we are searching what's going on and
then but this moment here and there we
hear a lot of stories and a lot of
rumors and impact on the economy
whatever however at this moment we are
still waiting until the government is
reconcile about the cryptocurrencies but
definitely they know what is the
difference between cryptocurrency and
the blockchain but they just just do not
know whether they need to have a look
but they need to you know think it as
security asset or payment method so now
they need to really figure it out and
I'm sure that they do a lot of study
yeah if there's not government support
government support like Korea because
Korean want to you know bend the
regulate the Bitcoin I just I feel like
that
and if I were you I want to like move
your company to Swiss so if there is a
perky government and why you want to do
this kind of stuff to in Vietnam sorry
sorry I didn't get your question very
clearly can you can you ask occasion in
Korean I don't mind in Korea Korean oh
I'm Korea Horomia okay okay expectation
was I didn't want to say from the
beginning if I say I haven't know that
you guys are gonna ask a lot of question
go ahead o take a while you're talking

trails not single
she wanted one but after you so we
understand the potential in great
presentation the one thing the one
number that I took away with me is that
you say so that currently there's 12
Vietnamese companies that operate like
with under the blocking space right
could you give us a few more details as
to like what sort of like sectors
they're focused on are they mostly like
research focused or like Toma chain
that's actually quite impressive right
like like like their own like platform
in protocol but or are they more actual
service providers is that FinTech is a
social like I mean I think you know I
let it cover from my slide and then like
57% they're like a FinTech so basically
they are running their blockchain
projects but they can either provide it
as a service or product so it really
depends but at this moment the financial
financial of mean financial technology
side is that the most active segment
then our than our local Vietnamese
financial institutions pretty kind of
open to collaborating that's based all
or like is sure there's like a lot of
dialogue going on right but overall like
their stance or like their policies or
you know their attitude so to speak are
they like kind of willing to Co work are
they kind of like do they view them as
like friendly like supporters or like
potential partners or more like
long-term like competitors or you mean
the dynamic between the FinTech
blockchain startups and like the
existing renamed Israel yeah yeah I mean
definitely we don't I mean in blockchain
technology as I say I'm a if you're the
startup company definitely need a lot of
support from other layers as well are
the players are the layers are the
players and then then definitely there I
mean blockchain we can collaborate a for
example you have like a cave ICU or
something you haven't like kyc fluff on
your very good idea however you do not
have any ice your cells platform and
then if there is another company who has
a really good structure or good service
product of that the other part then why
not we can collaborate and then we can
deliver the right product and then we do
not compete actually maybe I don't know
yeah but officially I'm not gonna say we
gonna compete
however in somehow in blockchain we need
to collaborate together yeah we can
accept one more question the question is
system you go oh you didn't wanna get a
block chain one and someone of sin and a

[Applause]
[Music]
greetings guys i mean it's really nice
to be connected with you guys um
so um
and again thanks for joining our um nfc
career road show um
so um as you guys probably heard from
jamin and jason we changed our format a
bit so instead of having a live training
session
and having a
pre-recorded video we decided to make
this video as a content
and distribute it to our own social
channels as well as communities that we
run
so i guess that's a better way and more
efficient way
in the situation like this so um once
again thanks for joining
uh why don't we go around and introduce
ourselves first and then we can get
started so my name is edward i work here
at hash as a head of growth
nice to be connected
yeah and i'm jason of co-founder of
espress and we are blockchain
accelerating firm based in korea
we are helping various blockchain
project to onboard this korean market
we are focusing on contents marketing
so yeah through this event we hope
a lot of nf project can
introduce
and to this korean community and to
share their insights
yeah thank you for coming
yes so i'm jamin at this spread as well
i'm the growth manager of this brand and
i look at the project various projects
and
try to look into what kind of new value
such kind of products actually deliver
to
the user and the ecosystem in general
and
we try to
help a lot of blockchain projects
for
korean communities to be able to
communicate such values together so yeah
thanks uh shall we start from stephen
than cozier than daniel yeah so my name
is stephen young
i am the founder of niftify so i've been
kind of in the nft space since late 2019
my business partner has been in this
since 2017
and niftify is a platform that allows
you to use your nfts as collateral to
get a loan so obviously valuations are
quite important for our market to be
able to function correctly
so i'm super interested in discussing um
some like hear you guys thoughts on this
and kind of give you some insight into
what we're seeing in the market at the
moment
okay hi nice to meet you guys um i'm
daniel i'm a founder and ceo of nfd bank
we are making an empty portfolio
management smart and easy
you know we provide financial indicators
portfolio tracking teachers as well as
valuations so i've met most of you guys
except so nice video today
happy to be here today and
let's discuss you know various topics
today
together thank you
so i'm gutier aka zoup i'm the ceo and
co-founder of nonfoundable.com
and so basically we are
the largest data platform about nfts
we have started our journey in the early
2018
and uh now basically what we do is that
we track and analyze the nft market uh
and we try to give some visibility about
what's going on on this market and uh
and try to
identify any kind of market manipulation
as well so
um the first question is it's very
common question so um probably
korean audience want to know more about
your project
and what what made you
all dive so deep into the nft market so
um can you explain
yeah sure let me let me go first so um
my business partner and i were having a
conversation early 2020 uh he like i
said he's been super deep in the nft
space for a very long time he's got i
think two and a half thousand
cryptokitties three and a half thousand
um got unchained
uh and it was kind of right at the start
of like the the kind of crypto winter
dying out um and he was looking for a
way to
um the market on crypto keys was still a
liquid when he was looking for a way to
essentially long ether um and
a couple of like big people in the space
have been doing kind of friendly loans
between each other
basically using a spreadsheet so that a
spreadsheet keeping track of who owed
who what and how
uh which nfts they would use as
collateral for that
so we basically just decided to build
that in a trustless way
and that's basically how we got started
so
i like just finished at an exchange so i
had a bit of spare time and then covered
lockdown happened so we spent um all of
lockdown building the first version of
liftify and launched in june
um and that's really kind of the problem
we're trying to solve is you know adding
leverage and liquidity uh to the nft
space which is
very useful especially early on in like
a new market right that's you know
there's a lot of people that are all of
a sudden making quite a lot of money but
a lot of that is locked up in nfts and
they don't necessarily want to sell that
but they want to be able to leverage um
like this capital that they've gained to
kind of do other things in the market so
so that's really kind of why we started
um and i've been kind of a collector
ever since and um like in love
especially with uh
i really like the gerunds of art
projects um but also a big fan of
cryptokitties so
um
i feel i i fall into this nft rabbit
hall like three years ago
um working for clayton uh which is
blockchain
kakao subsidiary in korea
um i'm a diva guy by nature so digging
in
um ethereum traces and figuring out
what's going on in you know in in within
the transaction was
very interesting uh thing for me and
while in in the meantime like i
found the
nfd space blooming at the time and at
the same time i figured out there was a
huge market friction between nft sellers
and buyers
due to
the disco you know difficulty in
price discovery so
that's when i thought i can
you know i can bring some
insights or you know useful tool for nft
communities to help them
manage their nfts in a better way and to
you know discover the price in a more
data efficient way so i started by you
know building very
simple
estimator for
my crypto heroes back then it was it's a
japanese nft
project nft project yeah
but then as time went by you know like
people are not just looking for a better
way to discover the price but then the
immediate pain point
the people having at that time was to
figure out how much they spend and how
much they earn
by flipping nfds so i switched the gear
a little bit and focusing on
nfd portfolio tracking feature first and
then i said as time went by and they
their um
level of expectation
um has gone up
and they asked us to provide the real
time valuation as well so
then we gradually like integrate our
evaluation model into portfolio uh
tracking features so that now now people
not only can see their revenue and
spending and their roi of their nfd
investment
right so but also they can also see the
real-time estimate of their nfts so
yeah two to summarize that we are
helping nfd collectors to you know hold
their nfts in a more efficient and more
smart way um
so we
started uh non-fundable with my
co-founder
initially in january 2018
we met my co-founder on the central
marketplace
he's living in canada i'm in france and
basically we were both trading assets at
that time uh we were trading land on the
central land uh marketplace and the only
issue we had
is that uh basically on a market like
that you the price you know is what the
how the sellers estimate the assets but
not what the buyers are ready to pay
so basically we decided to build a
platform where you'll be able to see
what is actually sold and at which price
so we are started with only
cryptocurrencies and decentraland at
that time and now we list um
almost 200 different projects uh so you
are able to track basically
the
all the sales of these android projects
with hundreds of projects um
and down the road we had a lot of
requests for parts for evaluations so
but if it's something that we know nft
bank is doing as well
but our approach is really based on the
market history so basically uh we are
working with some of the largest nft
collectors in the world like whale shark
or metapus
and basically we
provide them with a monthly or quarter
evaluation of their of their portfolios
so
the the main challenge with
this kind of valuations is that
basically you have a connection with
hundreds of different uh type of nfts so
it means that you need
hundreds of different mythologies
approaches with basically a lot of
different market trends and this kind of
stuff so that's extremely extremely
complex and um
today we are
basically uh yeah
we are doing this kind of a portfolio
evaluation we help a lot of uh
large uh industry stakeholders to enter
the space to basically understand what
are the trends what it means to create
an fnft what are the best practices
so today we are mostly focused on b2b of
that and uh yeah we we really consider
that the data with crop is just some
sort of a gold mine but we use to
evaluate assets or to help people
understand the trends
so um let's
go to the uh
my second question is that um i believe
you guys are dealing with some data
especially nfd data so my next question
is that in the world of finance and even
in the world of defy
there are some useful variables and
indicators which are helpful to find the
value of certain assets or
you know even stock markets as well so
for each of you which which such
indicator is the most relevant
regarding the value of nft
and
does this have a potential in the future
return
so obviously um
the flow price is one of the indicators
that we see oftentimes uh these days
um you know by looking at the flow price
we can figure out what's going on and
what's where we are heading right in
general
uh but then i don't see that flow price
you know flow price is very rough
estimate for
the true you know value of nfts but then
still it's very useful uh to
understand the big picture uh what's
going on right
but then
the indicators that i
think
essentially very important is
community-based stats so who makes the
price in nft space community right so
then how can we extract very important
information where leaving indicators uh
from community it's really hard
but then we are still digging
in you know these community
activities try to figure out um the
fundamental
you know
the basis for the price
yeah so
i don't know like we often watch
different activities going on in this
call discord channel and twitters
and you know as zop mentioned um
like i don't know there are so many like
watch trading going on in this area so
we try to figure out what are the
washing which trade watch trading uh how
you know is it happening here in this
space and trying to figure out
does it
affect the price of nfts so we are
looking at various different indicators
to try to figure out
the market
um yeah i totally agree with what
danielle said um basically uh initially
like everyone else we were only focused
on the cleaver uh the volume of usd
traded on the market which honestly is a
really really bad indicator to to
analyze the value of the earth of a
project so basically uh the metrics we
have built over time are some
some of them are basically the retention
rate so basically
uh what is the
loyalty of a community to a project so
are they really connecting uh often to a
project or to a game or not um
we consider as well the liquidity rate
so uh which percentage of the supply of
tokens are actually circulating on the
market
um and we have some other more advanced
metrics like some sort of a
centralization rate so basically is the
market only driven by 10 whales but are
just
yeah you know pumping a price or is it
some sort of an organic growth
and
as well as daniel said the what running
rate so is it only you know uh 10 or 100
watch traders just you know um
faking the market
so there are really a lot of different
indicators to take in account to
to know if the value the let's say the
you have a value of these assets on the
market is a real value or just a
pumped value
so we only correlate the value of an
asset with the health of a project
because um i mean
we've seen that recently with um
with art blocks uh i mean i'm not saying
that adblocks is victim of any market
manipulation but the price pumped way
way way too fast in really a short
period of time so
i i won't say this current state of the
market is really healthy just because of
that
it's maybe the current market value
but it's extremely risky as well
so we take in account the value and the
risk associated to this current value
yeah i
totally agree with you guys that you
know these indicators and data are
extremely important not only for the uh
nft price but also
to figure out you know
um
you know
where this nft market uh moves uh to the
next stage so um i will keep looking uh
at these data and uh yep why don't we go
to the next question jeremy
yeah so and if i just uh passed on the
previous question let me ask you
a question which is relevant to nfd5
platform itself so i've been following
your project since last fall
and it's really great to see it is
growing
day by day
so basically how i understand is that
your platform basically is a
platform where the collaterals are taken
uh in nfts in a way
and since it's a p2p platform
the lenders and borrowers are being
exceptionally careful in terms of how to
evaluate their asset how much they can
actually get out of their collateral or
as for the lenders they would always
think like
at which price or at which rate they
will be actually better off instead of
just holding on their ears or die to put
to other
uh divided yield farming platform so
uh
in here the most
important uh most interesting part would
be that how
this kind of pricing or valuation
information flows within your community
because uh when you actually click on
the link like how to evaluate your asset
on your platform then it directs to your
discord platform
so
uh could you tell us a bit about how
your community actually behaves and how
such kind of input information flows
over around
yeah sure um i actually think i can add
a little bit also onto the matrix
because we we've got some metrics that
um
they come after price so
um so let me touch on that and then i
like i'll also um talk about how like
the the information flows through the
the community
so
two of the things that are um like
important on our platform to manage this
risk that you talked about right so you
people taking out a 60 to 90 day loan
the market might move at any point
during that time
so so they're taking on essentially like
a long position on the value of the
assets that they're landing on so what
we see there is
two metrics that really matter are
loan to value ratio and the interest
rate that they charge and we can
definitely see a
big variance between projects in both
ltv and
the the interest that people charge
as an example
things like um autoglyphs they are super
low ltv
uh and uh quite high um super high ltv
sorry and quite low um aprs because
compared to many other projects like i
feel they've almost been left behind a
little bit you know if you look at the
prices of uh things like um like a
videnza in art blocks which i mean i
think it's a great project but you know
if the dangers are selling for 160 plus
ether like some of them for evil at 700
ether recently
and then autoglyphs floor is what is it
for it's up a little bit now 475 when i
checked yesterday
i just don't think that that that kind
of matches up in terms of kind of the
like
the historical significance of the
project and so on the other thing that
you see a lot with um autogloss
specifically is they don't trade very
often the prices only really go up you
know they don't ever like really drop
and start selling for less so it's a
much less risky loan to make so people
are quite happy to give a 60 or 70 ltv
because they know they can sell it
because so few of them go on the market
and secondly a lot of those invest those
lenders they actually just want that
asset so
there's almost a way to get a potential
bite at an asset that doesn't really
sell very often
because you know somebody's taking out a
loan they might kind of there is like a
higher chance that they might not um
repay that loan than just some random um
glyph holder who's got his asset listed
for a crazy price
so
and then we see that quite a lot so i
think crypto punks are
also
kind of very low ltv like relative
very high ltv 50 to 60 percent uh with
like a
relatively high and low apr
there i think it's a little bit more
risky i do think that the market is a
little bit overconfident in them um
again just if you're looking at you know
ten thousand punks four at like 200
something thousand dollars
again just even comparing that to other
lava labs projects i do think there's
like a little bit of a like a bubble in
the pfp space going on
so
so we can but we can attract those
things and at least with the punk is not
going to zero right so so what a lot of
these um investors like a lot of them
have quite lenders have a relatively
long um uh time frame so they're well
okay if i if i get a default now and the
market's down for a little while you
know three years later i'm sure it's
gonna be worth more than it is right now
so
so depends on the on the actual land
there
and also if you're like a 50
ltv you can flip it for 75 of ltv um
kind of relatively easily um 75 over the
floor price
uh and then for those projects
specifically floor price is kind of the
thing people look at so they compare
full price to recent sales um and then
you kind of you have a sense for you
know if your full prices are like you
know 500 ether but you only had sales of
the 100 ether or that mark like you know
there's a discrepancy there
and then
um so that's the one side of it and then
the other type of invest lenders we have
are collectors and these people they
actually just want you to default so
they'll give you low interest rate high
ltv
hoping that
you the market moves a little bit and
then the people kind of blink and then
let go of the asset
so
so those are quite interesting the other
thing that that's a good way to see how
healthy the the project is is how long
does it take from listing to getting an
offer so for example if you list a glyph
or so the other day we had a a
crypto punk listed
uh
wanting a 250 000 loan within an hour
they got a um offer and then you know a
couple of hours later the loan was still
full
and typical with autoglyphs too as soon
as somebody lists an autoglyph within
minutes they will get an offer um
whereas other assets is a little bit
harder
the crypt i mean the art blocks like
during the run up everybody was happy to
give loans it's a little bit calmed down
now i don't think it's quite as frothy
uh board ape yacht club is on fire at
the moment so anything that's listed you
get really good
offers very quickly
so so there's a little bit of a
when the market is hot it's very easy to
get a loan
so so that makes a lot of sense and then
what we do also then see is when the
market dies down
we see more loans at lower um
valuations and then the real blue chip
assets do much much better uh so you
know it's like if something so that for
me is a good indicator that something's
got some staying power is if if you can
still get loans on it even when the
prices aren't doubling every few months
um every few days
the way the market's going at the moment
that's a good indicator for me that like
the people who do value these assets see
a long-term future in it and they're
okay to kind of even with the markets
flat or down to still take risk on these
assets
thank you stefan that was pretty
extensive so basically it's all about
the market confidence that
uh the users or communities are
commonly really feeling about towards a
certain asset
so
and that's my question is
as you know
like unlike pontiff token
the the biggest problem with nft is the
lack of liquidity you know so there are
there are many
attempts many attempts were projected to
this liquidity
like an mt-20 or
nfcs so i think there will be a
next trading team or dao specializing
into
invest nft or sf
so how do you think about what kind of
complex product using nfd and default
so can you
turn your opinion on yet
yeah
as you said uh as you mentioned that
um yeah nfds are essentially
illiquid assets that's why
there are a lot of experiments are going
on to cope up with this liquidity
problem
so
definitely a lot of like structured
products will
come out soon right so i i think nfd5 is
doing really great job to bring
liquidity in nft space
also i think
you know nft 20 or nfdx they are kind of
doing like derivative they are building
derivative products right so i i think
more and more these experiments will
bring new opportunities in this market
as well that's why we're thinking that
you know non-fungible.com and nfd bank
have to work really hard to bring really
essential indicators and valuations
so that
you know
what we think about the like when we
think about the
history like we you know we suffer a lot
from
subprime mortgage crisis and that can
also happen here uh once we you know
bring these and try to
securitize these electric assets to
build a trench and you know we do all
kinds of you know
magic magic things right so
definitely there should be a lot of com
more complicated financial products will
come and play and we should prepare for
that
yeah um
i i think that um yeah i mean this is
this was totally expectable but uh we'll
see this kind of you know uh
fractionalization of nfts this kind of
creation of liquidity um
my let's say my only concern about that
is just about you know if this risk of
over speculation on the asset and we see
that
already today with these uh nfts that
are
not that much liquid we see a lot of
speculation so with assets that can be
20 10 times per day uh there is
definitely a risk of you know uh of
course around just the value of
some specific nfts so
um
there is i mean it's maybe just a
concern for me but yeah i really see a
risk of a verbalization
of the other space uh due to that so
i think that uh related to these uh
creational liquidity uh we'll need some
sort of
platforms or regulators just to ensure
that there is yeah some sort of uh
countdown on the market when needed
which is not easy
yeah so
um so i think also like you need to keep
in mind that there there really are two
kinds of people buying nfts now is
people trying to speculate on price
so number go up that's what they care
about
and then there's people who are
collectors and i think a lot of so for a
lot of the big kind of true collectors
that i know they don't like
fractionalization because essentially
they give up control and they give up
ownership of that asset they can't then
do things with them it's not really
theirs
for them like there's an emotional
connection to actually owning like the
piece and owning a slice of it
isn't what they're interested in
so so i do think you're gonna see this
bifurcation in the market where you're
gonna see people who are
uh
you know they're speculating the market
that we need exposure to the growth of
nfts as an asset class and they're gonna
like things like you know b20 and
fractionalization and all these kind of
things and they're people who are art
collectors or um you know kind of gamers
who they want they want that sword to be
able to use in their game or they um
they love
that art piece because it's something
like owning a part of history so i do
think there's going to be a difference
and i suspect that the the collectors
are going to be the real drivers of the
of the price they're going to be the
ones that are moving the floor
and then the speculators are people that
are just going to can kind of tag along
and try to get exposure uh so so that's
just my opinion and it's like we're kind
of seeing that in our market too
i mean um we
we've done analysis recently about the
current market trends and we see more
and more people entering the space and
basically all the newcomers are
these you know traders really there to
make money quickly um and that's exactly
what you described we see some sort of a
division on the market between the
traditional collectors or people that
are let's say pretty wealthy in the
space and ready to pay a lot for really
something that resonates with them and a
lot of people that just come here try to
grab as much as they can and see if
something goes up basically
and the result of that is that only in
august 2021
the nft market on ethereum
represented a little more than 2 billion
usd traded
so just to give you an example uh on
2020 the global energy market on fram
was 20 million
so it's really booming
because of these newcomers because of
his traders
so we just
briefly touched on the surface of a
possible fractionalization of nft for
better liquidity and
devising a little bit more complex
financial product on chain
and
in fact i also personally think pretty
often about the potential of nft
fractionalization and sometimes i wonder
like
let's say if i fractionalize a people's
artwork uh in terms of a thousand years
in 20 tokens which represents one
people's work
then
what i think is that is it really
possible because let's say if i just
happened to own this one piece out of a
thousand
and i somehow lost my wallet which
actually has this document then
does this mean that
that people's artwork which has been
rationalized is lost forever
because it cannot be really claimed
in a way so by fractionalizing it
we put the called uh
the
nft in the collateral to risk in a
certain sense because it's going to be
lost forever and
if
if some of the tokens are lost forever
then can the nft still
perceived to have real value
what are your thoughts for all three of
you
i mean so i think some of the
fractionalization protocols have ways
around this so you can if you own more
than 70 percent of the um the the
fractions you can force buyouts in some
of them so like so they are these kind
of forced buyouts
so
i think it's relatively safe if somebody
can collect more but i do think that
point of it's not now it's not really
owned by anyone so i think it makes
sense for
art pieces for example so like i can see
like i think people is probably a good
case for fractionalization
is it is a me bit i don't think so uh
and a and a punk also you know those are
things that like individuals use kind of
you know me bits are going to become
avatars that you use inside these
virtual worlds so so i think it depends
on the type of asset uh if it's a like a
standalone piece
that you're not there's nothing a dao
can do to increase its value
you don't have to make decisions about
what you do with it
you know i can see
fractionalization's almost like putting
it in a public museum that's then it's
kind of semi-use usable by everyone um
but it's like that museum is then owned
by all the the fraction holders
but i think there's other assets that
are productive and useful and
are more suited to an individual pfp
projects all of them really are
it's for somebody's own
profile use i don't really see them
fitting in factionalization super well
yeah i agree i mean
this is a tricky question if
the asset loses its uh integrity if
basically a
wallet
is lost or something no i don't think so
i think that
basically
just like owning shares in the company i
mean let's say that i own an issue in a
company and
i don't know i just lose access to my to
my bank account or something at the end
of the day
the company
was the same is the same
so it's just a matter of maybe of
liquidity just like we've seen on crypto
packs for example um the value of crypto
box today is mostly due
because of the lack of available crypto
packs because so many of them are
currently
stuck on wallets and basically
completely lost and i don't have any
precise figures about that but i would
say that at least half of the crypto
punks are lost on wallet so basically
there are only half of the supply
available so with the example you
described i think that uh if x
fractions of nft are lost it's just that
there will be
less fractions available and potentially
less liquidity
but that's my
my take on that
yeah i strongly agree with what zob said
i i have very similar opinion and also
technically speaking nothing is lost
even if you
lose the
your ownership about the piece of
the arts because
you know as stephen also said we can do
like course i forgot the term but then
we can somehow get the ownership back
once
majority of the owners decided to do so
so
i i guess also like if someone loses its
access to the ownerships then
scarcity goes on right so
it might it might make
everyone else
happier not sure uh just consider it as
donating to everybody in the community
in a way
it's like a burning or talking right
um yeah uh now to think of it there is a
bit 20 token right and there is a way uh
so it is consists of votes then
there are ways to actually force buy out
the entire asset interval by
uh actually having like
a 70
of the entire b20 token plus some of the
dies that actually adds up then
that person can actually first buy out
entire uh asset involved so
that's a really
great answers from all of you so
actually a lot of people might have
uh questions about this nft
fractionalization and they also have
have thought about these risks and etc
so i think these insights coming from
you all of you three
may be really helpful for our korean
community to actually understand better
on an active fractionalization
so my next question is is i mean if you
see look at the um d5 sector there are a
lot of you know
more complex products like synthetic
products
or others so do you
think that they're going to be any more
like complex nfd based financial product
as well
so could there be like another term that
could be joined like like play to earn
in the future
yeah i think so
i
i think it'll probably
not come based so much on the arts
projects i think as soon as you start
getting yields um in these nfts so
tokenizing royalty fees or you know
those kinds of things all of a sudden
that nft represents an income stream and
as soon as then it becomes much easier
to value right like you can see what the
historical
income stream was what is the kind of
future expected cash flow and all of a
sudden it's it's much more a financial
asset i suspect a lot of these pfp
projects actually might move in that
direction you know so as board ape yacht
club starts leveraging its ip
and starts paying out dividends to uh to
uh ape holders all of a sudden these
assets now like they're generating yield
there's an income that's coming from
them
and then i think it becomes much more
suited to much more sophisticated
financial products uh i do think there
are some financial products that you
would need anyway so like hedging
um potentially insurance
uh lending like what we doing rentals um
you know so i think they are
like a bunch of things
uh and then i think what's gonna like
things are really gonna get weird once
you start having like yield coming
through on these assets uh because then
then you can start doing all the crazy
stuff that you're doing in um
uh in these kind of d5 protocols and
probably just plug those in almost
directly into a existing d5 protocols
yeah i have same opinion as as
definitely
um
you know once
the scholarship exit scholarship
managers found nfp bank like
you know like they found nfd back as a
very useful tool for them because you
know often their axes are scattered
around different wallets and they had
really a hard time managing these
different you our wallets right so
once they settle down on an nfd bank
their next
um
expectation from us is to
help them to issue bonds right like
security tokens out of nfd bank so
as stephen said like ill generating nfts
will be uh a thing uh for the future
like it's not a future it's currently
going what's going on here in nfd space
so they
you know
the scholars make profit out of playing
uh axes and they earn slp and they
split their revenues to their
scholarship managers right and then
since managers are
managing their portfolio on an empty
bank we
can clearly see
how much each scholar
earns throughout their lifetime right so
also that means we can do like dcf kind
of methodology to do valuation for the
scholarship which means we can build a
product on top of this scholarship stuff
so we can
literally like wrap this whole
scholarship thing to build a financial
product
and this is the you know this is the
common way of building uh um you know
structured financial products in
traditional financial industries so
this will definitely come
um
into nfd space as well and this is going
to be really
interesting topic
absolutely um
yeah
i don't want to be the
the party breaker but yeah i think that
this will happen one way or another but
i'm not really
sure it's a good thing and i'm not
necessarily sure it's needed because at
the end of the day most
most of nfts
are meant likely to have some sort of a
use case i mean
uh uh is article use k i don't know if
that's another topic but basically if
you think about utilities about game
assets they are meant basically to
to be used one way or another so
the more you consider them just as a
store of value the more their
their true value i mean that true use
case is hidden behind that so
i just see some sort of
the correlation between the financial
use of the nft and the actual use of it
so
and and that's why i mean we are in
touch with some banking group that are
thinking about that but are currently
working on how to
create some sort of a complex financial
product based on nfts uh basically the
votes that we know like um
like a whale shark and um and metapers
are basically some sort of uh store of
value based on nfts so
we
see that will probably some some sort of
weird monster financial products
but yeah mom
i'm not a financial guy personally so
i'm not really convinced about the the
true utility of that
i think also like a bit of what you
touch on is you so at the moment we talk
about nfts like their one thing
uh and you know
i mean if you think about what is an nft
it's a unique digital thing
which it could literally be anything
like the design space for it is almost
infinite right so financial contracts
can be nfts like a whole bunch of stuff
we haven't even thought about so
so i think we almost now like i think
2021 is probably the last year where we
can talk about nfts like as if it's one
thing you know so i think it's going to
start bifurcating i think you're going
to start seeing
you know it's completely different like
we already seen liquidity positions
being represented as nfts like that's
about as far away from like a
art blocks
as you can get right it's a completely
different animal it's just using the
same underlying technology and this
concept that
it's not it is not a you can't just
trade anyone for any other one right and
and if you think about the real world
most things are non-fungible you know
like it's money
and commodities
and like
like stocks i guess are semi-fungible
right
but everything else that you have in
your life is non-fungible uh so and if
you can think about all of those
different things
uh and like there's gonna have way way
more of them because there's there's
like almost a zero marginal cost of
creating these things in the digital
space right so this is going to be an
absolute explosion of
number of nfts and kinds of nfts and
some kinds and
uh you know it's
i think
and but i agree with you like i don't
know that like those complex products
fit in the art world or in gaming assets
uh
but for like there's gonna be a whole
subclass of nfcs that like i mean they
financial nfts uh so that's kind of my
view i agree and you mentioned something
extremely important there is this notion
of it's probably one of the last year
where when we talk about nfts as a whole
because i'm convinced that
down the road uh nfcs will become
mainstream when we won't be talking
about nfts when basically when you
purchase a ticket to access a concert or
something you'll purchase something
which will be an nft but you won't know
it and at the end of the day no one
cares about nfcs it's just a technical
mean so what is important is what you
can do with that if you can
make money if you can i don't know
enjoy the
game or something like that so it's just
like you know talking about tcp ip it's
a technical protocol no one cares about
that people care about facebook about
amazon about the experience not about
the technical mean so for right now
everyone is still looking at
nfts as the technical aspect of it but
underwater it will
glory disappear i think
so it's basically all about the
abstraction of the subject of which is
being nft tokenized in a sense so it
really depends if somebody wants to uh
extract financial value out of the
subject of
uh something that is being tokenized in
nft then
it could be perhaps used as more
formidable financial collateral rather
than just
something that
should have
been used for its uh true utility it's
it's very interesting and then i'm
actually learning why i'm speaking to
you guys okay uh
let's go with the a little bit lighter
questions
so if your project could make
partnership with any company or any
project that is
both uh that could be either inside or
outside of the blockchain space and
which company do you think you'd like to
make a com a partnership with and why
would that be
so i mean like for for us really it's
about distribution right so so we've got
just liquidity coming out of our ears
there's lots of money wanting to learn
on these assets and it's
getting
access to these kind of high quality
assets uh so for us it's anybody you
know obviously like a lava labs
partnership would be awesome um
uh but i think
probably with wade's working i mean so
we're working with nft bank um to kind
of work on a bit of a partnership there
so really for us it's
where people view and look at and use
their nfts we want to be able for them
to say from there and go hey i need a
loan on this and then kind of in
platform kind of experience
that uh you know that that whole loop so
for us it's really kind of where do
people go to view the nfts and manage
them like wallets you know like as soon
as we have an actual really good mobile
wallet that supports um like great nft
integration would be great to be able to
kind of just you know
get a loan on your assets directly from
where you're actually looking at them
um on our end
uh yeah we may have two answers to this
one uh
the two partnership partnerships we will
like
would be with the sec the american sec
and with potentially blackrock
this example basically um
we have always we always had a third to
um
to
keep the nfc market as something healthy
and something that
could live forever so
the sec just because of
will probably need some sort of
regulation at some point but this kind
of actors need to understand what are
nfts and why they are different from
other um
other assets so
we love to work with them just to help
understand how
we can regulate if there is something to
regulate on nfts and
about blackrock it's just because i
think that this kind of guys are
definitely looking at nfts i'm kind of
sure they don't understand exactly what
it is and i'm sure that with just a
couple of billions they can definitely
break the market or just do terrible
things so
still i think there is definitely a need
for education and for training for these
guys
great nice
um for us
maybe
smp
right any other nft projects that need
our valuation models so
nft5 is one of our partners
we are happy to provide our platform to
bring our you know pull of our user base
to
different projects and
um
and then we'd like to also like for an
empty bank we a lot of have nfd holders
and investors and collectors right and
then
we our best
effort
to serve this community is to bring more
useful things and introduce more
um you know like
useful things to our users so to
really like
to do our mission
um
best we try to have more
other players to
like
coming into our ecosystem so yeah i mean
i think
all of nfg projects can be our potential
partners and we'd like to have you know
make a partnership with you know this
great amazing like projects even like
not with nonfungible.com we can do lots
of you know interesting stuff together
in terms of the analysis and
you know
bring
data literacy to the community so that
you know the new players and newcomers
can understand the nft
from the data perspective in a much
smarter way so
yeah i mean we are all partners
basically
yes non-fungible also has this
newsletter and they also published
annual report last year so
that is totally viable i guess
yeah i mean i learned a lot from you
know norfolk.com report like there are
so many
important information and so many tips
so
yeah i mean i love your report and i
keep when you're monitoring everything
you guys do i love it
thank you we we are only we can't wait
to uh tell you more about the upcoming
your report is going to be a massive one
so i think this is our last question so
what's your vision in this connecting
market
and how this nft technology can make
world better
or
or how you should how should you
or more casual users approach
this nft market sure uh so i think i
kind of hinted at this when we were
talking when i was saying i think this
is the last year you can talk about nfts
as a category so
i think it's just gonna permeate
everywhere i think
it's a more
what's as least as important as like
fungible tokens in kind of what the
future the digital future is going to be
and then bringing kind of property
rights to
the online space
and i think you're just going to see an
explosion of you know like almost going
to be like a whole new gdp that's being
produced purely online with with native
digital assets and native digital
currencies
uh i don't think we've got any idea yet
of like what that's going to look like
and i think
um you know like we said said earlier
it's
that tcp ip and the internet analogy
right so at the beginning in the 90s we
were talking about the internet as if it
was one thing and now we've got
you know cryptocurrencies and nfts and
facebook and instagram and
these huge message boards and wikipedia
and it's you know just
how much you can build from this like
single primitive of having a way to
connect computers together and having a
standardized language to talk for them
to talk to each other
i think this like this dual concept of
internet native money and internet
native property ownership
and ownership rights is just
we've just barely scratched the surface
it's going to take us 20 30 years to
figure out what to do with all of this
stuff
and then how should people approach nfts
right now very very carefully um like
these prices are nuts um uh especially
the which projects are high
i do still think that like the
autoglyphs i think are undervalued like
founder crypto kitties i think are
undervalued
i think a lot of pfp projects are
overvalued
some of them are going to be
like worth a lot in the future most of
them are going to be worth nothing
so be very careful like where you deploy
capital now like all of the big
collectors i know are like have either
already sold most of their things that
they're willing to sell or they're not
buying at the moment um and they're
making shopping lists of things they
want to buy when everybody says and if
these are dead
so
you know be super careful
about the vision um
yeah i have a strong vision
in metabolism general and i guess the
blockchain tag will be uh
critical pillars one of the critical
pillars for the metaverse so it will
pave the
you know
important economic layer for the
metabolism and nfts will be the economy
or financial
assets or goods that
people
trade
in this new whole whole new world
and
so nfd bank want to be a the first nfd
based bank or like bank for a metaverse
so we have vision for that
and
in order for new commerce to
come into nft space i think
it's really tricky question um
i guess
you know people are often are very
speculative in these days but then
i guess if you really think about the
long-term
value and then
how those nfd's will come into play in
the metaverse
i think they have to be
really think about
this i don't know this new concept and
new vision for the metabolism i think we
have to
somehow
help them to learn this space you know
you know in depth and
try to bring more materials and
learning you know
i don't know like we have to still
educate people to adopt this new world
yeah i i think so so this nft market is
crazy you know
indira was sold a lot of expensive price
and people are in a meeting just
it's creation so
people should need or be careful about
some new nft
absolutely i think that in the next few
years everyone will need to be uh
passionate
tolerant and forgive the mistakes
because we'll see a lot of mistakes uh
of
any kind basically technical ones we'll
see hacks with his scams we'll slip on
this we'll see so many terrible things
but basically
we'll learn like that and we'll learn
what is good what is not what is
possible what is not what should be done
and what should not so it's we are
really i mean
we are at the right time at the right
place and everything we have to do is
just to do our best to just follow our
efforts and
and enjoy the show i think because
honestly it's going to be crazy and
uh you know
i've seen yesterday a sale where someone
purchased an asset for
400
usd three years ago and he sold it back
for
almost almost a million
in three days
i mean
that's not normal there is not nothing
else there but that's part of the game
and that's why everyone is talking about
nfts today so
one way or another there's a lot of
visibility of traction due to that is it
healthy no not at all but that's part of
the global organic growth of the space
so what we'll see is a booming space
where as you say stefan it will be
divided in a lot of different families
of sections of segments
some of some of them may crash some of
them may rise and i think that we'll see
more and more extremely large
stakeholders like banking group like
game studio and others entering the
space
with a lot of time with a lot of due
diligence i guess and at that time
the nft space will change drastically i
guess
yeah i mean i totally agree with you
guys
but the thing is that i believe that you
know nft is strongly related to like
social capital so people who are buying
this nfts are not really they're not
really care about you know
you know the price of entities that they
buy
the k the thing that they care about is
their social status on twitter discord
or in this whole market right so if you
buy a crypto pump that represents who
you are and that reveals your
identification right so maybe it tells
you that you're like a
whale or you're a pretty og in the
market so i think a uh
nft has very interesting elements um
that we have to study so
you know regarding
what you guys just said i
i i agree that some of the nfts are
overvalued and
you know it's it's a crazy market but
the thing is that market will survive
market will exist so that means people
will keep buying these nfts so when
there's a crush
this this question is not just for me
but for the whole community what nfts
should people
keep their eyes on
so when there's a market crush in in in
crypto market people buy bitcoin and
other major altcoins like ethereum right
but in nft market i have no idea so you
guys are nfd experts so if you get if
you guys can touch on that then they'll
be great um i don't want to give away my
whole shopping list because then i won't
be able to get them
but
so so i think anything lava labs you
know like they're early um i think look
for things that are historically
significant so so you know even though
like odd blocks for denzes are expensive
now i do think they're going to have a
long term place in the market and retain
value because they're one of the first
like visually very varied like very good
looking fully on chain um generative
projects
so so that's kind of what i look for i
look for things that are new and like
historically significant high quality
kind of as especially in the art world
it needs to actually have you know some
kind of uh like aesthetic
kind of quality to it
and then
also just like as marshall mcluhan says
the medium is the message so anything
that actually uses the blockchain
in an interesting way
where you couldn't have made that art
piece before the blockchain existed so i
think deaf beef is a good example of
that
um i think a lot of this stuff that um
like aziz is doing with the um
pulse squares and
avid lines i think that's really
interesting
uh like art blocks i think also because
it's like the first like really big
generative um uh on chain movement
so
so that's kind of what i i look for i
look for things that are sorry
significant high quality
doing something that's really blockchain
native and not just sticking old art
onto like a new kind of platform so so
that's kind of my
criteria that i look for ah yeah i agree
with what stefan said basically uh um
i think i would personally grab a rubber
bank if i could uh but yeah i mean the
only question you have to ask yourself
is why should you purchase this one does
that make sense what is the story uh is
it something scarce is it something that
is unique and i mean don't purchase an
nft because it's an nft purchase it as
just like any other thing you'd purchase
just because i know you like it you
think it's something unique it's
something that has made history or just
because you are creating a collection
because you like you love that my
co-founder is currently a pretty massive
collection of nfts which basically are
all the 721 because it's the
erc721 so basically he owns the punk 721
he owns basically all the 721 in
basically all the collections possible
and it will never sell them just because
it's what it wants it's
it's yeah it's it's a collection so
yeah never purchase an nfc just because
it's an nft
just because it resonates with you it
means something it has a value i mean i
have a lot of axes and i play with them
it's not because i think that one day
they may worth more
and at the end of the day they are
really good access i play a lot with
them and they're worth in a lot just
because they're really good actors so i
think that's i guess that's the right
approach for me if you have to really
buy in the dip then i would say
i will buy punk because because i missed
the opportunity before that i i agree a
lot
i don't have one either so yeah you said
you know
yeah me too foregoing the opportunity
was you know
so
and then i often think about what's the
what's what
what's the bitcoin for
nfts what has
that much status in nft space i would
say it's a
crypto punk so
you know
if if the
the opportunity is given in the future i
would definitely buy the tip for crypto
punk
all right sounds cool
i mean um i guess we pretty much asked
what we have here
right jason and german
so once again um thank you very much for
um joining our show i mean it has been
pleasure it was really interesting and
um very fun
so um i i mean should we uh should we
capture this um video call and admit it
as an nft later
probably yeah
yeah
yes i mean
legendary video clip right so yeah on
future you know nft leaders in the one
space
and then uh we must make it as an nft
anyway so um it was nice chatting you
chatting with you guys and then uh
thanks thank you once again yeah
thanks very much for having us
once again thanks for um joining our
korea nft road show
it's really good to have you guys on our
event
me myself my name is edward um i work as
head of growth here at hasht um we are
the investor of xc infiniti as well so
um i've been knowing i mean we have been
working with axa infinity for a while so
nice to have you
nice to meet you again so
grayson
yeah hi guys so um this is jason and we
are we are de-spread
we are blockchain accelerated from base
in korea
we are having lots of blockchain
projects to bombard this korean market
and especially we are focusing on
content marketing like uh making us
great article or podcast or youtube so
for this for through this through this
event we hope
uh enough that can introduce
themselves to korean community and share
their insight for this enemy market
yeah thank you for coming
yes and
i'm jamming at this spread working with
jason as well
i'm a growth manager at this spread so i
look at various projects all around
which tries to deliver a novel
value proposition towards the users and
the ecosystem in general so really nice
to see you guys here
hey everybody i'm jeff or jiha
i'm a co-founder of sky mavis we're the
inventors of axi infinity
i'm on the growth side of things so
my goal is to increase the size and
strength of the community
economy
so yeah it's really nice to be here uh i
love korea i actually usually live in
korea recently i've been living in korea
for nine months
um so thank you
let's meet up
um
and yeah
i think people will love that
hi everyone my name is gabby nizon and
i'm the co-founder of yield guild games
for ygg so
we are a play to earn gaming guild which
means that we invest assets in games
such as axi infinity where we we've
invested a lot in the axes themselves in
land and the access token and we in turn
lend out these assets to our players so
that our players can play the game and
earn money can you explain about um x
infinity and why gg
uh
and tell me i mean and another question
is that many people wonder about what
you guys work together in terms of
business relationship because you know
people have read a lot of medium
articles and tweets about um you guys
are working together so um it will be
good if you guys can elaborate on this
as well
sure so i guess i'll go first
uh so yeah uh
we've created this game called axi
infinity the goal of the game is to
introduce the world
to blockchain technology which can be
very scary and new uh through something
that's accessible and fun and relatable
nostalgic nostalgic is one of the most
powerful
human emotions so
uh
axes are pets you can battle them
collect them you can breed them they're
kind of like pokemon they're rounds and
they're cute
uh but yeah the you know the secret
sauce
and the thing that we do differently is
that um the in-game economy is
controlled by the players so the axes
the in-game resources these can all be
sold to anyone anywhere in the world so
uh yeah
it's it's become a very empowering
product for many people all across the
world
and uh yeah i guess maybe that's a good
segue into what
gabby is working on
okay so i've been part of the axi
community as a player as a breeder
as an nfd investor since late 2018 and
i've been playing the game and really
been interacting with the community
since then and you could say that ygg is
kind of an outgrowth of the work that
i've been doing in the community last
year around this time axis started
becoming very popular in my country in
the philippines as a way for people to
escape poverty during the lockdown and
yeah so this is actually how
axi started gaining a lot of its user
base from from the philippines and when
the scholarship or the lending program
started it also started becoming popular
in the philippines where people who had
a lot of axes started lending them out
to players who wanted to play the game
and earn money but didn't have any money
up front to purchase those axes so
that's what ygg does we invest a lot in
the axis we were probably the largest
breeder of axes in the game and we uh we
along with the work of community
managers from around the world we lend
these out to
to different players who who are
basically earning um a living
from from playing this game and yeah
this is something that we've been
scaling um in that's infinity and other
games as well and it's uh something
we're continuing to do so this is my
first question to ygg so
yeah ygg is like something some kind of
guild of games so this is really
interesting idea so
uh you know how how did you come up this
idea of borrowing xc and getting
interest so why did you start this ygg
sure so uh well of course guilds
themselves are not a new concept in
games there's a lot of guilds from world
of warcraft to runescape to everquest
i guess what's new is guilds who are
able to own their own assets because the
assets in the game are
are nfts on the blockchain so we combine
the idea of basically a player's guild
that has its own
money basically and that invests into
the assets and owns these assets into
the game and this has become a really
great way to onboard a lot of new users
into nft games and into blockchain in
general because
as jio said earlier
learning blockchain is actually a little
bit scary and hard and if you start with
the technical side it scares a lot of
people away but we start people with the
gaming side there's a lot of people
around the world who are gamers who
would like to have the ability to
monetize their gaming skill and that's
what nft and play to earn games do like
coming into a game like axi we take care
of the kind of initial onboarding via
the community these just have to think
about playing the game and as they start
earning they they learn about blockchain
along the way and this is a great way to
bring mass adoption to crypto in general
i have a uh question um for both of you
so um
people ask that the primary function of
any game including you know blockchain
game as well as traditional game
is is entertainment and having fun
but um in blockchain many blockchain
games core function right now seems to
be play to earn
so what is your take on this and
do you think that you know this plate to
earn um
[Music]
you know it will be um will we continue
uh yeah so i'll i'll kick this off uh so
incentives right have always been a core
uh
motivation for gamers right um there's
right people are gamers are playing for
status they're playing for loot
um yeah they play for fun i played a lot
of world of warcraft i didn't really
have that much fun it was mainly i
played for social reasons and for status
um so they're always been these actually
non
fun
uh motives for playing games it's just
right we're now adding a new
powerful incentive right um
which is you know a monetary incentive
of course this needs to be right it's
most powerful
and it's most sustainable most
defendable
when you're combining it with okay right
like you're also playing for for status
for social reasons
there's also you know some fun um
but yeah i think like when we add these
monetary incentives in the mix it just
becomes very explosive very powerful and
this is what we've seen so it's just
another
i i think like another tool um and a
game designer's tool kit um that isn't
but i think it turns games into
something that
is much more powerful right because it's
something that can really help you
uh
in real life
to it in a in a concrete way that
maybe was uh yeah that's just basically
been uh not possible um
for almost all gamers in the past
yeah so there's this misconception that
people are just playing to earn and not
having fun and
i think the people who are leveling the
schism actually haven't observed the
community playing the game so people are
actually having tons of fun just from
looking at what the conversations are in
discord on twitter to how the
communities are forming and if you
actually dig into axis retention numbers
they are basically top of the world best
of class in 30-day retention which
reaches up to 90
so if you look at from observing the
community and the data axis actually a
lot of fun and it's just a way that
you're actually layering another
component which is earning money on top
of that fund
yep thanks for the answer
okay so
both of your projects value proposition
towards ecosystem participants
it is made possible by the native
characteristics which
is offered by the blockchain technology
basically
so in this case in ethereum uh
so in retrospect what impacts and
changes are you bringing to ethereum
yeah so i i guess i'll go first uh i
mean i think we're bringing
ethereum and blockchain to a totally
different
user base right
50 of our players have never used crypto
before 75 of them have never used nfts
before
um so yeah we're getting into the hands
of new people which is
what's needed we need to get into the
hands of people who aren't right the
same group of 10 000
uh people within the ethereum community
the nft community
um so we've really expanded it to
uh yeah to a new user base so i think
that's you know fundamentally what we're
what we've brought um i think we're
showing
the route to adoption which is you know
being very benefits based making things
that are beautiful um that work
seamlessly together i think we're
showing uh i think we're
laying out a
kind of a road map for the ecosystem on
okay uh how applications can work um in
conjunction with ethereum so for example
we've built our own side chain it's kind
of like an application specific chain
uh which still accrues value to ethereum
through right transactions that are uh
happening through through the bridge so
deposits and withdrawals so it's still
helping ethereum but it is also
allowing for this scalable uh
application with many different
transactions without
um basically
pricing out
everyday consumers everyday users um
i think that's we're done right we've
basically uh we're we've shown
a
kind of playbook for getting this
technology into people that haven't been
using it historically so i think in
retrospect that might be like you know
our most significant
uh
you know contribution which is basically
kicking off this
era of consumer adoption
so uh we're bringing i would say a
social coordination layer to to
blockchain so what we're doing is not
like i would say technical by nature but
we're bringing a way for our users to
come in and congregate and invest in
assets and find a way to share those
rewards among themselves so i would say
that um like these uh user driven dows
are i think the the future of user
acquisition and user aggregation in this
space and that's how you're going to see
people um onboard it to blockchain
do you think xc can
prepare prevent
xg is very popular in south east asia
and so why does it concentrate in
especially in philippines
so did you do any focusing on this area
or any marketing or supporting
yeah
uh yeah so
i think the combination of factors the
philippines is always a great test
market for games and games will
typically do like alpha and beta tests
there
i think a lot of it also is you know i
went we i went to the philippines i met
i met gabby and he became this local
champion super early right um in 2018 so
i think i think like just gabby has a
lot to do with it as well and um we've
gotten this kind of critical mass that
got kind of hit
levels maybe um a little bit ahead of
schedule i think there are a lot of
places in the world that look like the
philippines did
eight months ago
right now
so
yeah i think i think it's a combination
i mean the philippe filipinos
uh they speak english which really helps
as well because we don't have
localization um they love mobile gaming
there's high like mobile mobile phone
penetration a relatively high crypto
adoption as well it's very i think a
community based culture so things that
are working can
spread very quickly
it's also where there's low uh
average income so so you know if earning
20 to 40 a day it can be life-saving
life-changing to people
um in these countries and in southeast
asia and especially you know the
philippines which has been i think
especially hit hard um so yeah i think
it's a combination
but i do think it is just part of a
a broader wave that is going to sweep
over the world and um i think i think
yeah organizations like ygg are going to
bring this movement to all corners of
the earth
yeah so agree with what geo said the the
only thing i'll add is that
filipinos have always been at the
forefront of every major social network
this dates back to friendster 2003
facebook starting 2006
and a lot of mobile and social games
where there's a high amount of
participation from a filipino audience
except that
the filipinos have been somewhat
invisible because they haven't been
monetizable
and now that um basically the players in
play to earn and in axi are able to earn
the same rate as anyone else around the
world now you're seeing a lot of
filipinos use the kind of affinity for
being first in mobile in social
applications and really become
the biggest major population in this
game because um suddenly their voices
are heard they're able to earn income
they're able to participate in community
and be able to monetize from it directly
which is such a powerful thing to do for
any community around the world
so recently um i've saw i've seen this
from the various media the thailand and
especially philippine governments are
are are making moves to regulate xc
infinity so how do you plan to cope with
this and is this an obstacle or
to actually
uh future
development
so so let me tackle this first because
i'm kind of on the ground i'm doing that
so i would say that the government is
trying to understand
the plato earned phenomenon and see what
applies
in terms of regulation in terms of the
earning capacity that people are doing
now there's actually no new law that
needs to be done because
these players none of them are employees
of a company we are earning
um
value assets in a game that can
basically be converted into fiat into
philippine pesos in various exchanges
so so so the trick is into communicating
with these authorities what framework of
existing laws
exists for example does it work in a
kind of gig economy model
there's already existing legislation
that says if you're earning below five
thousand dollars a year then you don't
need to pay any form of income tax so a
platoon gamer is basically a new kind of
freelancer but instead of you know being
a graphic designer or a programmer
they're basically playing for value so
yeah so there's just a lot of constant
communication
into helping authorities understand what
is going on in this new movement
great to know that uh jiho any thoughts
on this
yeah i think uh i think yeah governments
are trying to figure out what's going on
i think it's an amazing sign that
governments are are starting to take a
look right like uh
what's happening here
i think uh yeah we we put out a
statement which i think was uh yeah kind
of a landmark moment right because we
have this
digital nation um
releasing a statement um to a government
um so it was kind of a surreal moment so
i think it's really uh just an indicator
of the scale and
the uh responsibility i think that we
have uh now
um yeah i think i think you know that
every every local laws are going to be
different right so
you know we definitely
uh
are excited
i think for right like clarification
around different laws and um definitely
encourage our players to abide by the
local laws as they are clarified or
as they're set forth by their uh
i guess physical countries
recently there has been a
government
regulation being posed
by the chinese government towards its
people in terms of
regulating how many hours a minor miners
could play the games
uh that is which is three hours on
friday saturday and sunday so this has
been a really huge issue in the gaming
industry
and of course uh we are not really sure
how to track
whether the players of x8 infinity and
the members of the yg games are
chinese miners or something like that
but then i think it must have bring a
lot of impact to what you two are trying
to achieve
so
what is your take on this
recent chinese regulation being posed to
the chinese people
so
for ygt games
um
i'm pretty sure the majority
of the people
that
you are actually dealing with are native
filipinos
but then i think there is a potential
that you could grow much more globally
eventually starting from the other
regions of southeast asia countries
and then
china is a very big market in a sense so
do you think it's going to
impact your expansion to other
regions in asia
so
we're already in different countries
around the world apart from philippines
we're in malaysia we're in indonesia
we're in thailand
we're in brazil for example venezuela
colombia and there's a lot of
different i would say
works to each culture
on how they're playing games what local
regulations are so we just try to see
how ygg can be adapted to a local model
and yeah with china i think it's very
unfortunate that
the government has clamped down so much
on gaming but if that's the regulation
then we'll just have to
follow it and our our players will uh
basically just choose how to spend their
time playing these games
do you have any thoughts on this uh jeff
yeah you know i'm not a legal expert so
yeah uh
yeah i think like you know
obviously it's this is a function of
also like i'll just say maybe
philosophically this people think that
video games are bad
um which is a problem it's you know my
even my mom she sent me to boarding
school
because i was playing world of warcraft
all the time but what we're trying to do
is create games that help people that
teach them skills that can help them in
the real world um so i think this
regulation is coming as
a uh
or it's coming from a
a place of fear and
uh it's coming from this uh
notion that games are bad for children
but
uh we believe in a future where games
are educational tools that empower
people
and we think that games are going to be
very important and the games are going
to be a huge force for good
in society
unfortunately
right the games that exist out there the
mainstream traditional games a lot of
them are very abusive and addictive and
provide very little
i mean
in some ways right like it's it's harder
to see the tangible benefit from them so
um yeah i think like hopefully you know
what we can contribute is to
i think increase uh
is to i think open people's eyes to what
games can actually do and and why they
can actually be forces for incredible
good
yeah i actually totally agree with you i
mean
if we i mean
younger generation these days they spend
you know most of their time in the
digital world right so you know gaming
i mean especially uh blockchain game you
know plays i mean plays
special
um significant role uh in that space as
well you know these kids they actually
do um you know they earn money and then
they do a lot of you know activities in
the metaverse so i think a um as jiho
said
um you know
the blockchain gaming is is really
important for the future generation as
well this is personal question for
ygg so
how much did you generate the revenue to
this axi and small low portion and
beside xc which game you are you looking
for to edit in your portfolio
so we've generated a total of 59 million
slp uh gmv lifetime
and uh so you can check with uh like
whatever the exchange rate is and 10
percent of that goes to igg i think the
best part my favorite part about what
we're doing is that 70 of the gmd that
we generate actually goes out to the
player or the scholar 20 to their
community manager and um only 10 goes
back to the guild that said we actually
reinvest all of the slp that we make
into
breeding axes um and so that we're able
to serve more scholars around the world
so we're not really concerned about
taking a profit now we really just
really want to go out and
yeah spread the play to er and create
digital assets for the rest of the world
to use um i think we are kind of at the
very very early stage of the
plato urn and digital asset revolution
and we were trying to blanket countries
around southeast asia latin america
hopefully india and others as well
and yeah think of it as an uber for
digital assets where we want to make
these assets available for anyone else
in the world to use as for your second
question we've invested assets into
different games such as formula one
delta time sandbox league of kingdoms
guild of guardians amber sword
and others
as you know the current online and video
game industry relies heavily on both
capital and labor
so and is do you think that um x
infinity is any different from this um
how is xc
different from other normal game
developer studios um in in our
traditional
um sector
sure i mean so i've never worked at a
traditional game company so it's hard to
really understand
uh what's happening on the inside but i
think that we have a team of polymaths
um so right we're all gamers lifelong
gamers uh many of us are collectors
mathematicians i was really into
military and economic history uh central
banking so i think it
requires you to i think blockchain yeah
game studios need to have people who are
master community builders master
economic
theorists amazing developers because
you're building new technol with new
technology and you also have to have the
you know the game design
uh and it needs to be fun right so
that's why it's been so difficult for
anyone to really
you know
replicate what axes done right i think
we have like basically 90 of mark market
share within nft games right now
um because you need to put all these
complex
parts together right you can't just have
a fun game you can't just have a good
economy um
you can't just have good infrastructure
right uh
you need to put it all together so so
thanks for thanks again and then um yeah
looking forward
uh to our thank you
yep
thank you everyone
thanks jason thanks edward
welcome zach um to our korean empty road
show um it's our pleasure to have you
here i think a
audience here in korea are really
excited about what you're going to say
today
so um before we start why don't we
introduce ourselves so
me my name is edward i work as a head of
growth here at hashed and ashley is a
also investor
of
record which zach runs
so um again um it's it's great to have
you here jason
yeah i'm jason in
brad we are blockchain sra firm based in
korea
we are helping in blockchain project
easily onboarding korean market and we
are focusing
context marketing such as blog article
and video pr and you're making youtube
yeah so
japanese german is our head of growth
yeah why don't you say hello
hi zack so i'm jamie and working at this
pro as a growth manager
so
we look for projects mostly and i'm
i'm in charge of research about various
blockchain projects
both domestic and global so it's really
a pleasure to have you here
so
could you also please explain about
ricker and yourself as well
sure yeah well uh it's great to be here
edward great to
talk to you again and really special
thank you to the hash team and all of
you for having us um
my name is zach brush i'm the co-founder
and co-ceo of recurve recurve builds
white label nft solutions for some of
the world's largest global iep
uh we are blockchain and constituting
don't mince anyone chain we're able to
work with multiple chains our nft are
interoperable uh ultimately giving our
nfts the widest range of distribution we
don't have our own blockchain we don't
plan on having our own token
and thus we create what we feel is the
appropriate alignment of interest
between ourselves
and the brands and groups that we work
with to continuously improve as much
value
all right so
um uh the question that i have is that
um as you said um you are working with
some of the largest brands in the world
so um why do you think that these
well-known brands and these largest
brands are looking into nft and then
what potential and opportunities do they
see in the market
sure so i think a lot of these brands
are recognizing that a new trend is is
forming clearly and i think historically
if we look back at different successes
uh within the internet or trends or
new technologies emergence
everything comes back towards community
and community has been vibrant around
nfts and i have touched on this before
but if you look historically back you
see in the late 90s on the internet
bulletin boards groups got together and
table chat rooms and to reddit when
communities were indexed and people can
go and participate then to network
discord where people can actually speak
to one another
community
becomes this really powerful vibrant
thing and i think know that a lot of
these large ip these large brands feel
that nfts can become another extension
of their brand uh another extension of
community uh for some of these fans
so
to me
a lot of these brands are recognizing
the opportunity to use nfts as a tool to
connect with people and fans and
audiences that love their brand
for themselves but also so that the
fandom themselves can communicate and
find the community uh that's also built
around this shared vision
what kind of
nfts will uh recore will be dealing with
and then what sort of nfd could people
expect from your um platform
sure so
everything that we do
we want it to be really deep and really
have great storytelling when we're
working with our large ip we don't do a
one-off drop everything that we're doing
has to be able to live 365. it has to be
a full full experience so
anyone that's going to come to a future
recur experience and we're going to be
behind some of the largest ip when it
comes out in the coming months uh they
will expect or you know and be able to
see a road map and be able to see
something that won't just be there one
time but it will live on for years to
come and they know their nfts will have
you know
relevance in years to come because it
might tie into an experience or a
physical good or a game uh it will be
able to travel or leave the platform do
all sorts of different types of things
but most importantly there will be a
large element of storytelling within
these nfts that allow them to be 365 and
engage and engaging for the fans that
are going to participate in the
experiences
thank you
so this question comes from me
so
i found that you once worked at one of
the major exchanges kraken before so
exchanges such as kraken
mostly deal with bitcoin ethereum and
other altcoins
which are considered super fundable in a
way
and so
what did you see in this unfundable
token industry that made you really
shift from working on fungible tokens to
fungible token exchange to non-fundable
token exchange so what do you see in nft
and what's your vision on
so
i think it's a really great question uh
i've been involved in crypto space for
for many years as as you mentioned i i
got started at kraken five years ago i
was on the trading desk there and after
that i was at drw and cumberland uh and
then have been various roles in the
industry since then until until now here
here at recurring our entire team
actually a lot of the engineering team
has also come from very deep crypto
roots um some of the first team of
circle and polo and so many other uh you
know wonderful crypto businesses and
i think that for me one of the things
that
i i know i i recognized was that nfts
uh were ultimately going to serve as the
largest gateway for a
a typical fan or consumer or person to
access this greater digital world and i
had once previously thought it would be
crypto trading because as you guys know
a lot of the crypto activity has is
always around uh trading or in some form
of speculative nature even in nft space
um there's been so much speculation on
nfts uh and that's what got people
kick-started into it initially um
but nfts for someone that doesn't
understand finance is really easy to
grasp and it became apparent to me that
the
the broader
community of people would understand
nfps and thus it would be the access
point into this greater crypto ecosystem
and when i teamed up with my co-founder
trevor george who's an absolute pioneer
in the licensing space we realized that
we were you know a wonderful duo and we
built a tremendous team both from the
brand and licensing side as well as the
crypto side to combine the two
and make sure that we were able to speak
to the licensing community and speak to
a fan that might not understand crypto
while also bringing best practices from
the crypto industry from the exchanges
where we you know helped build the
original infrastructure and the trading
desks where we saw all sorts of
different things happen and apply that
to recur and what we're building here so
we end up bringing best practices from
the licensing and brand world best
practices from the from the crypto world
and get to apply all of our experiences
in both industries to to to approach
what we're doing here at recur and in
terms of you know where we see this
industry going uh we try to look past
the speculation uh at recur and we
really see that
nfts become extensions and i already
touched on this extensions of the brands
and the ip uh
that we work with and as i mentioned
before my my co-founder trevor has been
working with um
the largest iep in the world for tens of
of years as a very successful business
making physical products for some of the
largest ips world in the world as well
as digital storefronts for them
and this is a a natural extension for
them and the brands the ip they're
excited to get involved because it's
another way for them to connect with
their fans so
i see nfts
really becoming this tool for community
in the future and tool for engagement
and really become this really
special thing for fans because they will
be able to connect with like-minded
individuals they will be able to connect
connect and engage even more with a
product
or a or a brand or a musician or an
artist whatever it is and then also take
it with them forever wherever they go
maybe generationally give it to their
child or or a friend and that brand that
musician that artist can also continue
to talk with them so it's this
everlasting type of community and it's
it's a very powerful thing for the fan
for the artist or the creator or the ip
uh and nfts are clearly becoming a tool
for community
i totally agree with you i mean it's uh
i believe that fd is a core function of
um of you know
you know the connection um and making
community around us so um i mean that
was a great answer i totally agree with
you thanks
thank you
yeah so most anaptiya are using in this
day erc721
or erc 1155 standard
but recall purpose vip
2981
that gives
royalty back to creator
so can you explain in this
standard and how
project can apply this energy
sure so
the royalty standard is actually
something that can be used with some of
the others it's just a standard for uh
recurring royalty uh
so that no matter where the asset lives
or trades on ethereum uh the recurring
royalty so any secondary sale can accrue
back and go back to the original creator
so for us
not only on our own platform do we want
the original creator to be able to
receive loyalty but no matter where that
asset lives or trades in the future we
want the original creator to be able to
participate um in the sale and we
thought that was really important
because as nfts are becoming
very popular amongst artists and
creators and ip
one thing that we felt was missing was
the standardization
of a recurring royalty and ultimately
crypto as we all know breaks down a lot
of barriers it allows people to to
access different things globally but
also limits barriers just of
participation and if we were able to
create a standard for recurring royalty
people and brands and artists would feel
really comfortable with their assets
being able to travel and leave the
platform it originated because they
still would be able to participate in
all secondary sales and on top of that
even if you have an artist um that is
not so popular today but then they
become popular over time
they will still get to enjoy the
you know the their growth whereas today
that's not the case and i've been
involved in the the art community and
the uh entertainment industry
historically in the past and i have tons
of friends that that work in those
industries
and it's a real shame that a lot of
those artists don't get to enjoy
all the benefits and nfts allow for that
so at recur we wanted to create a
standard so that no matter where the
nft's traveled in the future the artist
the ip the creator would be able to
participate in those sales and it
allowed us to really make sure that
those assets could leave the platform
and when an asset is able to leave the
platform then the end user the fan the
consumer really gets full utility of
that asset really gets full utility of
that nft and can enjoy it in so many
different ways and we're experiencing
growth right now in the nft ecosystem
but what that really means is that more
capital is going to start flowing into
the industry amazing new companies i
hope are going to continue coming and
building and innovating in this space
you know current incumbents in other
sorts of industries are going to come in
and develop in this space and then
there's going to be this robust
hopefully uh network within um the
metaversus right not just metaphors meta
versus all sorts of different types of
places where assets and nfts can play
and interact and we want all the assets
that ever originated on a repair
platform to be able to go and
participate and really have utility do
you really own something if you can't
take it with you to your favorite
application or game or net social
network or marketplace no
you don't so we wanted to enable that
and allow for that so by having a
recurring royalty uh you know in our
smart contracts and open sourcing that
we can really be a
uh
you know encouraging party in this idea
that uh nfts should be more open uh of
course they should be able to leave
platforms right that by definition there
should never be a walled garden we had
seen that certain
platforms that we're dealing with ip
were creating walled gardens and that's
just not what we wanted to do whatsoever
and also we should encourage um
users engaging in the metaverse and
engaging in this space and finding new
communities and and finding new ways to
actually interact and utilize uh design
thank you
so
another question is that although
initial sale of major brand nfts happen
on ricker
then
we still expect most of the secondary
sales would happen on other energy
exchanges well-known ones and
let's say already well established the
standardized exchanges such as runnable
or open c
so how can ricker retain its users to
continue to stay on its platform
and how
and what kind of competitive ad would
require recurve to actually compete
against these well established nft
exchanges
sure so at the end of the day we are
creating
these
white label nft experiences for these ip
we're not just a marketplace we don't
just do a drop but it's a full
experience it's 365 you'll be able to
engage with our nfts and you can take
them wherever you want so you're right a
user could buy an nft off one of our
experiences in a primary sale if they
want
go take it and bring it to an open seat
or a wearable or some other marketplace
that pops up in the future uh
that becomes a
big place of liquidity definitely um but
we also have um
we also will have secondary markets
on our platform and we also feel that a
lot lots of communities will form around
our platforms because that is where all
the content is initially being created
and you might want to go and engage and
have community there but if you want to
take the asset and sell it on your
favorite exchange
like in openc you absolutely can go and
go and do that and we know that because
we have so much storytelling in our
assets because
our our nfts um
will tie into different types of things
and and games and experiences you will
want to come back and continue engaging
with it um so we are not not not so
concerned about that and we are happy
for our assets to trade wherever the
liquidity may lie our main goal and our
main focus is providing the best
experiences for the brands that we work
with and the easiest experience for the
fans to be able to engage with those
brands
and we think we're going to be doing
that in the primary and the secondary on
our platform but we also know that there
are secondary markets that a user might
want to take uh their asset to and of
course they'll be able to do so
so
my understanding is that it sounds a
little bit more like instead of recur
just becoming an entity exchange
it's more like a
premium launch pad for
you know various brand-backed nfts
in a way so
so i wouldn't even call it a launch pad
i i would say a launchpad is like a
one-off drop and that's not at all what
we're doing uh we're creating
experiences and we work with the largest
ip in the world you know a launch pad is
something that a crypto company will do
we're not a crypto company we we we
we're a storytelling uh business and we
and nfts are our media we're a community
business we have the number one
licensing and brand team uh in the world
when it comes to nfts and yes we have
the best in class crypto team too but
everything that we're doing comes back
to storytelling and community and
experience so
i would say not at all like a launch pad
but more like a full immersive
experience and you know we have nothing
in the market today um but we're coming
out soon and i'm really excited for for
everybody to get a chance to see you
know
what it is we're talking about here but
it's not at all like a one-off drop or a
or a launch pad
so
another question might be that from
well-established brands and ip's
perspective view
the decentralized nature of nfd also can
be seen as a risk or a threat which is
out of their control so there will be
secondary or derivative artworks that is
based on the let's say nft
that has been launched on reaker
and tokenization of these derivative
works can be really prevented in a way
the most notable case could be regarding
copyright or trade trademark
infringement and
relevant issues so how does ricker plan
to address such issues
yes so
all the ip that and all the nfts that
originate on recur we work hand in hand
with uh with the iep that we work with
so no user will just be able to come on
to the platform and
create something
we work hand in hand with the iep that
we work with um but what's important to
remember is that
you know decentralization uh if you will
while new in the internet world is it
has been you know existing in time
you know forever in the sense of
someone's always been able to go buy a
licensed t-shirt
and take it with them anywhere and sell
it anywhere and post a picture of it
anywhere and alter it or rip the t-shirt
or do different types of things and
there's different examples
um when licensed ip would come in and
try to prevent it or there's different
examples of they try to enforce
copyright and the same thing will happen
uh in the nft ecosystem that's not
that's not recur's job
to to do that but it's the iep's job to
enforce it if someone else is
you know utilizing their ip um in a way
that they shouldn't but we officially
officially license everything that we do
we work hand-in-hand with with our ip
um and have all the rights to put out
everything that that we release um so
for us uh that's that's not a concern
so this kind of issue or problem may be
really a problem if that person actually
claims legitimacy of this brand
instead of rather making simple sales
so so here's the interesting thing
when you deal with nft is it's right
there it's right there in the code
what's real
and what's fit
right let's use this for example if
someone's walking on the street wearing
a pair of yeezys right kanye west's
shoes if you're a sneaker expert you
might be able to point out and say you
know that's real or that's fake but if
you're not a sneaker expert you might
walk and say that's easy
but if
we're working with one of the largest
worlds uh you know one of the largest ip
in the world let's for example xyz right
we're working with brand xyz
they you know you know recur is the
official nft provider of brand xyz
and you see it right then and there you
know in the smart contract is this a
recur nft or is it not uh so it will be
very obvious in the future what a you
know knockoff or or fake uh nft is and
that won't really have so much value and
it's so obvious because it's right then
it's right there in the code so in the
non-digital world there's all sorts of
fake you know goods out there fake shoes
fake luxury handbags uh whatever it is
uh and you have to be an expert
typically uh to understand what's wrong
with fake but in crypto in nfts in the
digital world you see it right there in
the smart contract what's real and
what's fake and rocker is really proud
to be uh the official partner of so many
uh beloved uh ip
oh thanks for all these interesting
answers
no problem
yeah so
as you said before the
brand can interact with consumer or some
give some special experience to commit
consumer
so you know you know experience
marketing that that is great way to
marketing from brand sites so
how can a net can
make a special or memorable experience
for consumers like
giving something goods or tickets like
that
that's a great that's a great question
and i can't wait for you to see some of
the things that ricker is doing but i
can't give away all of our all of our
secrets right now uh but we're doing a
lot of interesting things we can't wait
to engage uh with the fans and
communities that we're going to be
cultivating and we're working hand in
hand with the iep to really make really
rich and deep experiences for them
around the entities
great
yes we are excited to see what's coming
up
so um i think um
we have
probably this this one is the one last
question so there is a big um
opportunity in asian market and then in
contents wise there are a lot of you
know great content for example like bts
you know i believe that there are some
some of the uh chances or opportunities
that recall can work together
here in nature market so what's your
thought on this
so first i look at nft as a global
market and
just because you know one region is more
popular today does not mean
another region won't come in
and
i think asia is going to be a massive
massive massive market for nfts
and we have some ip that is really uh
performs well in the asian markets and
we will be
working
very very closely um in in that in in
asia market and we're going to hopefully
be putting boots on the ground or we
have boots on the ground uh in in these
regions um to address uh
to address the market in a meaningful
way so i i do think it's a meaningful
market it will be a meaningful market
and crypto in general asia is a very uh
prominent market so
it's
the
early adopters of nfts
are are people that already understand
the crypto space and there are so many
early adopters in this asian market so i
do think that the asian market will
start growing very rapidly and quickly
and we are definitely um thinking about
the asia market and we are working with
lots of ip that is very very prominent
in
asian markets so
100
i think asia could even be potentially
one of the largest markets for energies
i i totally agree with you and hash and
this spread can help you scale your
business here in korea and and other
asian markets as well so yeah good to
hear that yeah we had a great question
and then the answers that you provided
for us was
were really great as well yeah a lot of
times
i have one thing so yeah i have last
comments to
korean community or users in korea
what's that
that's not comments
yourself
the last comments is that we are working
with some of the largest ip in the world
as i mentioned before it has really
global reach i think the community in
asia in it all throughout asia and in
korea are going to love some of the
things that we're working on and we are
very very excited for everyone to see
what it is and participate and
you know really thank you to the three
of you for for inviting us and we recur
looking forward to working closer with
you over the coming months and being
able to speak and reach uh the korean
market and community more and
and learn how we can be working closer
so
with that like truly we believe nft is
our global market and we are treating it
as such and it's important that we work
hand in hand in in in so that we can
accomplish that
thank you
thank you for sending your thoughts
thank you it was it was a wonderful time
so i'll have a have a great afternoon
and then i'll reach out to you again
soon bye next week
all right

acquiesce and our onion haseo Sean and
Nicky leap neither so I think I'm gonna
transfer over to English now because I
see a lot of non-korean faces in this
crowd but before I talk about what Oh
Bernays what uber is doing I'm gonna
start off with a quick personal story so
I have young kids at home and whenever I
traveled I realized that my my wife
would be very angry at me and I started
thinking why she's so angry all the time
and I started realizing it was because
my kids would trouble her a lot and I
start thinking what if there was a copy
of me a copy that looks like me it talks
in my voice it has a personality like
mine and it's always at home so my kids
can talk to it and that copy can read it
stories as well and hopefully my wife
will be happy so after four years of
hard work like we have developed great
technology but my wife is still not
happy but that's a different story
but today I'm going to talk about Obon
I'm the CEO co-founder of Oban we're
based in Los Angeles and like we start
thinking that as we go about like our
daily lives on the internet or any kind
of an app there's so much data about us
out there
what if we can start using the data to
make something useful of us and that
data actually cannot be an extension
office and we shy looking at this copy
the concept of the copy the human copy
and it's like not only should I have my
copies why not everyone off you can have
your own copy and we start popping the
calling this copy some people call it
avatar but we call it PI like a personal
AI so I'm gonna give a quick demo of
what my PI is
but also I should say that this pi it
should not just be some static
representation of me it should be smart
as well and maybe we can see it in this
demo hi
I am a virtual copy of Michiel made
using almonds artificial intelligence
technology as Nichols personal ai ai
enabled Michiel to spend more time with
his wife and three kids enjoy a nice
hike or go off-roading Neha washing eco
light sashimi Shadia Rajan - why nam
chunka nong khiaw who - holding one mean
awesome konnichiwa
cocky gain he called a desk are only a
boon oppressor opens the technology
wheels ok ok as VP mija so I only speak
English but my PI has smart enough now
to learn other languages and it can now
speak these languages as well because
it's all run by AI and as you can see I
mean my PI is way more handsome than me
way more younger than me it has even
more hair than me actually so we look at
it as like your virtual representation
your copy it should actually be someone
that it has yo fundamentals but it
should also be looking and talking in a
way that you want it to be you want your
real life to be you might not have the
time to do something like in my case I
don't have I'm always traveling for work
for open and I wish I was home but I
don't have time for that
so my PI can be home reading the kids
stories and my kids actually they speak
Korean because they go for Taekwondo I
cannot speak Korean but my my PI can
speak Korean to them
they can also speak in Chinese and other
languages but we should also I'm also a
big fan of actually a lot of the SM
group like girls generation or akb48 and
Hatsune Miku and as I hum what if my PI
could sing and I told we told our
engineers and scientists and they came
up with this technology for pi I'm also
a pretty good singer I have a better
voice than the real Michiel let me sing
for you so actually my Pi in this case
and again this is all made by AI it has
not only learned to look like me using
AI talking my voice using AI learn
different languages and speak it in my
voice using AI it does also learn to
sing in my voice but then I was thinking
huh I am such a big fan of Korea I love
Korea it's all my favorite countries
we go in
maybe some for now
[Music]
Oh
and this is one of my favorite songs and
I really wanted to sing it I cannot sing
it myself I wish I could and I'm a huge
SM fan obviously and but now I cannot
sing it but my PI can sing it my PI can
dance on it and now I can show it to my
friends and I feel so proud about it so
this thing called PI like and we started
looking at deeper and deeper into it and
I'm gonna talk some more about it also
my co-founder Adam is in this crowd as
well but in his case he wanted to make
his own pie and here is Washington
either young country no John Doe cha-cha
hotcha shriti daughter Paige England
said hamantash Rijo what you should ha
ha ha wahoo you bankers were shootin a
cioppino to show the vision for euro yen
hissing homage and original or
high-grade he'd had hunger
heh underbid ha ha kyun everything here
like even not just a face and the voice
but also even the movements of the
avatar everything is done by AI so we
are the only company out there which can
actually combine the face of the voice
singing visual animation all using a are
in a seamless manner and make it
available in two different use cases so
what is this pie it is something that
looks like here it talks in your voice
it has a personality like yours and we
say looking deeper into this technology
that we made how to make sure that it's
protected it's not misused and that's
when we started looking into how to have
it secured on a blockchain before I go
into the blockchain aspect of what we're
doing in terms of adoption some
introduction about our company we have
some we are very honored to have some
amazing investors from just from Korea
we have a couple of big investors like
SM Entertainment is an investor in to us
there as you know they have one of the
largest k-pop groups now we also have
softened Korea as an investor and
outside of Korea we have $0.10
which is like I think number 4 company
in the world now in terms of
market cap they create WeChat and also
we have other big investors as well if
you're interested you can like check
them out and we our team is in Los
Angeles we're expanding into Seattle we
opening up an office actually today's
our Seattle office opening and are we
also hiring in Korea so if you have any
candidates please let me know but this
is some of our team members and about
about 55-plus right now in the LA office
70% plus our PhDs and advanced degrees
from Cal Tech Carnegie Mellon I saw some
carnegie benefit guys out here USC UCLA
Berkley and in different areas of
technology from like machine learning to
computer vision to natural language
processing and speech synthesis so yeah
so the team is pretty strong we're
always hiring always growing as well so
as part of like protecting your PI like
we should be looking at like my pi it
looks like me and the technology we made
is so simple all it takes is one selfie
just one selfie and your pie is ready
you speak a few sentences and your PI
can now start talking or singing in your
voice it's that easy but we start
realizing that what if someone was to
misuse my PI and how to protect that and
thats when like about an ear or so ago
we started looking into blockchain and
we started working on this project how
to adopt to this project PI blockchain
so a few things that we started looking
at was that how to make sure that the
data of the user is completely protected
it's also controlled by the user the
second thing we were side looking at was
we do so much work in AI and as many of
you know AI requires two big things one
is lots and lots and lots of data and
second thing is tons of computation
power and we shall looking at if there
are ways that we can actually utilize
computation power on the blockchain and
the third one is that we believe in this
philosophy of what I referred to as the
humanistic information economy which
if I do something can I get something
back in return it's just a very
fundamental barter system
what is project-by-project pi is an
ecosystem of personal artificial
intelligence it is a 3d intelligent
avatar that looks like us toxins things
like us and embodies our personality an
open platform allows us to create our
digital profiles where our PI's work for
us exchange information and complete
tasks on our behalf it is a personal
information economy where we control the
data that our PI's create and how we
were compensated for it so this is alex
waters is one of the technical
architecture of project pi and he
actually was also a member of the
Bitcoin core team so that same
explaining in his words or what project
PI means to him so like what is project
PI and what it has is a platform on
which there is a token solution that
creates a fundamental humanistic
information economy on top of that
there's many companies right now which
are building applications we have
companies in areas of healthcare use car
companies art foundations and education
companies which are building on top of
project PI as well just like Obon is and
then like there's a lot of like like
miners who are not just the traditional
- of blockchain but these miners are
also contributing their computation
power as well as they are contributing
to things such as authentication of data
and getting compensated for that so I
don't want to poor folks with a lot of
detail but a lot of the information can
be found on project PI dot-com Pai a
project by comm but this white papers
out there but these are some of the
things that we like realized for
important for urban as part of the
adoption to the project PI blockchain
the number one was like how can we make
sure that every person spy-like we
believe it's not just my PI but it
should be everyone in the world should
have their own PI it can be verified the
second thing was like everyone should be
able to get compensated for all the work
that they do in the entire ecosystem
and it should not be like me just giving
my data and other people make money off
me and then also that I should control
my pie my pie belongs to me it's my ID
and it should be in my possession at all
times and also we started looking at how
can this like how can that when I
contribute data it's not just helping my
pie improve but also it's contributing
towards everyone's pious improvement as
well so these were some of the
fundamental reasons we started adopting
to project pi again like lots of
information on this but the platform is
about peer-to-peer transactions lots of
users coming together on one platform
contributing data and utilizing the
resources of the blockchain so the
blockchain itself has three fundamental
layers this data layer there is a
storage layer and the blockchain itself
and again like if you have questions I
can answer them offline but this is all
been described in a lot of detail in the
white papers as well so we look at the
entire economy and like how can we drive
a peer-to-peer AI interaction and use PI
coin as a way to compensate individuals
for their efforts and also drive folks
to contribute more data upon their own
independence like how they want to do it
they can decide and they can get
compensated for it which actually helps
in the overall growth of AI for everyone
so a lot of folks are very interested in
knowing when project pi we launched this
information is on the fa Q's of project
pi calm but actually a project by block
chain should be launching actually in
the next quarter very soon and opens
first app on the blockchain will also be
launching along with that we have some
introductions of the app and we welcome
you all to try it out the applet run as
well so this is a website but here is a
video that my team put together
[Music]
so what she was trying to convey was
that can her pie be used for shopping
and in this case he took one selfie her
pie was ready she was able to adjust the
dimensions of a pie and then the pie was
able to actually find out like all the
dresses which suit her budget and fit
her body and she was then able to make a
decision very quickly because as we know
all the girls we know love shopping and
pie can make your life easier with
shopping this is another video
[Music]
so all the technology is already working
and we can give demos later on
[Music]
hi Nikhil can you tell me about obey
Obon is an artificial intelligence
company based in Pasadena California our
proprietary technology enables you to
create a photo real 3d virtual version
of yourself from a single photo and two
minutes of speech oh ok so what is the
relationship between project pie and
open Obon provides the core technology
used for personal AI and project he
provides the blocked protocol to keep
these personalized secure ok thank you
for your time you kill so this entire
thing I mean one selfie of a couple of
minutes of my speech and it makes my
life easier because now I can use my pie
to talk to interview candidates for
example and tell them about my company
so we actually are planning on launching
our first app on the blockchain is
called piyo and it's a way of expressing
yourself and as you saw like music is
such a big part of our culture with this
app you can take one selfie your pie is
going to be ready it goes through an
authentication process as well on the PI
blockchain and once that's done you can
actually start using a PI and you can
now just read one sentence and your PI
can actually be singing and dancing
singing in your voice and dancing as
well and everything is then augmented
reality so if anyone is interested in
making their PI we can do this after
this event but here is a quick demo
[Music]
so this was like for girls who made
their pies and they came together to
make a ghost band and the process for
making your pie is very simple with the
pyro app you sign up
this is the blockchain wallet on the app
itself
and this is your selfie based 3d avatar
and this is the authentication process
a whole joy was reaping this is part of
the KYC
to ensure your avatar is protected
and you cannot customize your pie
take me out to the ball game take me out
to the crowd or it's one two three
strikes you're out at the old ball game
take me to so it's very easy if anyone
is looking at testing the app as well
please let my team members are here in
the crowd please let them know give them
your test flight email ids and we'll be
glad to share our app the test flight
version of the app so you can also make
your own pie test it out and share with
us the feedback so this is from a girl
standpoint how she makes her pie
and all these features are already
available on the app so you can try it
out yourself
[Music]
happy birthday to you
[Music]
[Music]
and now you can share this on Kakao so
these are some of these screens again
apps ready you guys can come and test it
out but it's pretty simple it's pretty
straightforward just make your avatar
one selfie that's it and authenticate
yourself on the PI blockchain so you can
register yourself and then you can start
using your PI for creating new content
and sharing it with your friends on
Kakao there's so many other more
features being added to this app but
this was just a way like you know a
proof of concept to show that how easy
it could be to make your PI and making
sure that it's not misuse by registering
it on the PI blockchain if anyone is
interested they can also scan the QR
code here and this would add them to the
list to download to get pi PI o app on
test flight so please feel free door
down main scan this QR code as well
alright and there's also another app
that's going to be launched very soon
it's called PI up and that's going to be
a project PI's own wallet for storing PI
coin and also the interface is going to
be in Korean as well besides other
languages and it's going to be available
both on app stores and Play stores it's
going to be launched sometime next month
as well and as I said the interface is
in Korean very simple just like any
other wallet it helps you store my coin
and also transact with PI coin and again
if anyone is interested in testing it
out please let us know and we can share
that on test flight or Android so thank
you again for giving us the opportunity
thanks to hashed as well and please let
me know if you have any questions the to
Marissa maneuver by Rodriguez thunder
anybody have has a question
okay
so I was looking at your address you're
on Union Street are you related with IT
Oh laughs yeah so opens one of Albans
first investors was Idealab led by Bill
Gross and yeah all of our entire team of
engineers and scientists is still in the
idea lab office yeah because I used to
work right your lab years ago so I've
noticed the address okay but the
question I want to ask is um so the sec
is really trying to crack down on ICS
and can you talk about your coin and do
you see any conflict with it being a
security and having problem with the SCC
yeah so I'm here as CEO of Oban so I'm
here to talk about the launch of piyo
app and what opens technology is doing
so I'm not in a position to answer about
SEC regulations unfortunately
could you once you've created your pie
could you connect that pie to a
knowledge base and for the pie to be a
representation of that knowledge base
absolutely that's one of the most
important things that we're doing is
what you saw right now was the pie had a
face it had a voice and it had movements
on the face but what was missing was the
brain and the brain comes like what
you're talking about is a chatbot so you
could ideally connect it to something
like a LinkedIn to start with you could
extract all your information and a
narrow domain chat board could be used
to drive your pie and as you train it
more and as you know a eye is like a
baby when it starts off the more you
spend time with it the more you train it
it could get better and represent
yourself more total enjoyment oh they
took a nice menu so could you explain a
bit more how the token works in the
economy so we saw the product very very
interesting and how is the token being
used yeah so a few things that are going
on right now with the token is that in
order to get authenticated you actually
have to use a token because the token is
now going to the folks who are actually
working on the authentication they
actually verify that the person who is
trying to use the app is the same person
who is actually on the ID so it's that
kind of an kyc and the people who are
doing that work they get part of the
token that's one part of it the second
part of it is that we are collecting
lots of data we're also working with
lots of universities which actually
using data and they actually now are
paying people who are contraband data
with a token as well so these are a
couple of the things and third is you're
working with several agencies and
celebrities to actually come up with
more applications for virtual clothes of
our video games and all those are online
features can actually be bought with
token as well
to create your pie I mean like you can
start creating it but to in order to
start using it it has to be
authenticated and tied to you as the
individual and then you need the token
to be authenticated all right I see her
next question okay in Germany mondo cool
day oh oh you said hi can someday mimic
human human themself right
how are those states Taylor's going to
be saved or work in blockchain system
yeah I should also mention is that that
is one part of the technology which is
the most like for this or for us
actually at this point of time and the
premise here is that like as part of the
ownership the data can the data be
stored in your own wallet as well and
that way it's not stored on some
centralized server but you have full
control on it and it can then bestow on
the wallet and then it would be part of
the normal encryption that goes into the
water as well so that's how we are like
that's the goal to store the data for
you
in the water itself
yes so they can request you for your
data and if they want to buy your data
they can buy it with a token for example
but also it might just be for
interaction as an example we are working
with a lot of celebrities to create
interaction between fans and celebrities
so a fan can pay a token to interact
with a celebrity for some point of time
and it can be for singing together for
having a conversation and that can all
be with the data but with a token how da
da da da she scored here one more
questions I can get to her I see a lot
of like fake Facebook profiles these
days and I'm sure like somebody's gonna
copy my identity I mean not mine but
somebody else is by their photo and
three minutes of their voice and how do
you how are gonna authenticate them that
it's really them who's making their
identity so which is actually one of the
fundamental reasons which we which drove
us towards pi blockchain was that we do
not want my avatar to be misused my
voice to be misused with my family and
that's why we go through a full kyc as
well so that before you start using your
PI you have to go to the authentication
process you have to submit a sample of
your voice a sample of your face and
also your ID and all those three in
conjunction go through like set of
minors authenticators and when the it's
like a CAPTCHA and once it attenti kate
then you can start using it the tombow
and come back superstructures No thank
you thank you I'm Sammy thank you
[Applause]
well first of all Mike thank you
we're going to do this you're welcome
I'm so excited to be here just got off a
panel together I know we did it was good
that's great you were have to stop you a
few times you did you cut me off that
was less great but you know good I've
seen you a bunch of times we hang on the
time we're friends don't we are
religious opping together we do but I've
seen you more in Asia
Guerra loving jr. and and more and more
sudden San Francisco so can you we talk
about this all the time but I just want
you to hammer down yeah yeah well so I
we talked about on stage today why are
so few American investors coming to Asia
and we talked about why that's that's
interesting but why am I here and and
and I've been to keep coming back to
Korea and as I said on stage that part
of it's just that we've seen so many
great deals and all of them introduced
by you and we just keep making money and
you know that's important because we
have investors we have to make money for
them and so the continued business
success we've had here means I'm going
to spend and continue to spend a lot of
time here we also go to Singapore quite
a bit we and we have a lot of friends
there and there's a lot of crypto stuff
going on there this is a much sort of
flight than Singapore though
yeah single force brutal yeah and we
actually haven't done many Singapore
deals but you know there's a lot of
conferences and events er but Korea is
is fantastic you know and before you
invited me last year
I'd never been never know with all those
years in TechCrunch and then we came out
here well what a TechCrunch was
obviously a blog a news site in Silicon
Valley and before crypto tech was
centered in Silicon Valley and everybody
would come to me right and so the VCS
really never changed never never leave
either because everybody comes to Sand
Hill Road or San Francisco crypto is
it's a different world and if you want
to get in the best deals you have to go
where the deals are and and that means
Asia and in particular Korea and and I'm
willing to do it so yeah so you're
saying missed opportunity for your peers
in debate I don't understand it I think
you know I tell them and they just don't
want to hear it
so yeah good for us is this very
different than all your years at crunch
fund yeah yeah being a venture so quick
photos event
venture firm right right and early-stage
which is exciting and similar to crypto
in the sense of early stages usually pre
product or products just come out and so
you don't know yet there's no revenue
you're making a lot of guesses about
whether the product will be successful
later stage venture you're you're
actually using financial metrics to make
your businesses so it's similar in that
way and then a lot of the crypto stuff
we do you're making you're making
investment decisions before you have any
idea how it's going to do but this has
the added dimension if it goes liquid
very early hmm and then you have to
choose did not sell or sell and I find
that fun and also the the crypto markets
are so volatile that you have these
things greatly compacted business cycles
and so everything just move so fast and
I love that yeah now what about what
about on stage you were talking about
gaps right yeah and services that the
consumer portion that's missing in the
US have you had a chance to look at any
of those in Asia no well some but
nothing I've liked but I was just
talking to your team and I know that you
guys through your accelerator or your EQ
Bator you call it are gonna start really
focusing on gaming I know you'll do
other stuff as well and that to me is
good like if you're if because Korea is
an important market for gaming and if
you're doing all the filtering for us
and we can look at those deals that's
gonna be something we're really going to
look at yeah I've seen some gaming stuff
in the US have you have any of them come
across your desk you don't mean gambling
right not gambling just getting stuff
right I've read in the news about some
stuff but we haven't looked at any deals
yet cool and this is really timely
because just a few days ago it'll pay
coin Tesoro in bull run again yeah
what's I mean you're focusing a lot more
on handling live assets right a lot more
yeah what's that been like for the team
like what's the outlook like for this
year well so we we were we're hedge fund
but last year we were acting like a
venture fund and doing deals and if we
when we liquidated positions we go back
into ether or Bitcoin and we were doing
next to no trading we have core
positions in crypto currencies but next
to no trading I've merged with another
hedge fund another funds just a month
ago and it was announced a week ago and
these guys are hard core like technical
and fundamental traders and so they
and we have started trading aggressively
and exactly the right time and so that's
Derek or focus of ours it's greedy which
again in the u.s. those funds don't
touch that stuff right yeah you know I
realized like we've gone back and forth
about crypto but I've actually never
heard what got you into all of this
stuff when once you want the true answer
like the kind of the marketing answer
let's get the true answer all right so
the true answer is it happened because
of a date with a girl really yeah so I
was in crypto in the sense that I bought
some Bitcoin and ether like everyone
else in Silicon Valley was like twenty
seventeen sixteen thirty thirteen okay
yeah and not a lot but enough to
understand it because we were doing some
some crypto investments through my
venture fund so but in 2017 in march 21
I had a date with a girl Natalia who you
met right she was in crypto and and she
was encrypted when she was getting ready
to an ICO their company's called proppy
my PR opy and and she was telling about
these icy O's and I hadn't pay much
attention to him and it sounded like a
like a scale mm and like a pyramid
scheme and but I kept talking her about
it and I started doing a couple of deals
and you know in 2017 it would have been
hard to lose money on ICS right I'm
right just about through much anything
yeah so I invested in a few things and
thought well I'm really I'm really good
at this some really good money and I
decided at that point to raise a fund
right because venture funds have trouble
making a lot of we still like knee-deep
in crunch fund yeah yeah and I wanted I
tried to push my partner to let's start
another all crypto front and he he's
didn't have the passion for it and so I
decided to do it on my own
and and then I raised pretty quickly and
I decided to do a hedge fund I thought
that made the most sense right and
that's how I gonna do it so very cool
yeah all right any any outlooks for the
future you can share with our audience
it's gonna be wrong it's gonna be wrong
maybe we could record like five and you
could cut them and then add the right
one in because I I don't pretend to know
I was talking to so
2018 was a rough year yeah we closed our
fund we made some investments in
seventeen but they were like before we
close we closed our fund the first
like January 2nd or 3rd the high point
of the market was like a few days later
it's over a few days I'm like this is
great you know we've made 10% returns in
a week and then the market fell apart
and then it was 50 weeks of 51 weeks of
hell
right 51 weeks yeah yeah and and so I
don't obviously I'm not good at
predicting markets I idea is that this
is going to be an extremely important
part of the world economy at some point
in the next few years and therefore I
need to place some bets put myself in a
good position and if we do well we'll do
four well for our investors beyond that
I have no idea no I mean you've been
doing venture for a while so that one
panel I was at may be able to the IBM
event right and you were talking about
just being early investing a lot of
funds being a good investor yeah that's
right that's a strategy that worked out
really well for you I just want you
Michael laid out well Tara is an example
like I when I there was some like Alex
today had passed on Tara he's super
smart he's more than me different Alex
Alex PAC yeah Ryan black you also are
super smooth thank you
but Alex passed on Tara and we were
talking about wine he had some very good
reasons for passing yeah he did my
reason for investing is it's a same
reason we're invested in uber when uber
made no sense like it just it's obvious
to me that Tara's gonna be spectacularly
I should have a question on that
I saw the uber deck but they raised with
you actually committed on that deck yeah
if you go back we would uber just
launched before they'd ever raise it and
TK like like wasn't quite involved the
founder was not gonna be an operator of
this yeah yeah well at first he was just
like the founder although he was it's
not his original idea it's get cancer
exactly but Garrett wasn't actually one
of you know no he never was involved
right look I still made it made the
investment did because if you you can
actually see like I wrote about our tech
rep said well this is spectacular and
this is when uber was just black cars
right and I could already see how it's a
black car but it's a phone with an app
you can put a phone with an app at
anyone's car and they can become a taxi
and I wrote about that and so I just you
could tell I got it and I look I've made
some bad calls
I first article about Twitter was that
Twitter wasn't gonna be a stupid failure
so I I mess up all the time but it's
okay if you mess up is sometimes you're
right in venture and so I got it so for
me Tara and a couple other deals we
invested in last year are just obviously
huge winners and I'm very excited about
them but I think when it's all said and
done
we will have made a lot of money in 2018
when those investors play out just like
I think you guys will even though it was
a brutal year and yeah so I invested my
gut quite often but now my new guys from
bite size Capitol they're very much like
number crunchers and I actually think
that makes a good partnership where I
have my gut they have the numbers we
fight if we come to a decision I think
it's more likely to be a good one very
cool so yeah but I just want to thank
you like I'm only here because of hashed
I only came last time because of hashed
and if you guys hadn't pushed me to come
out here and be part of the ecosystem
here I would have I would have ever come
yeah we're gonna make you come out again
like I was here anytime you yeah very
cool yeah thank you so thank you so much
for your time yeah let's go some dinner
yeah let's do it
hey how's it going uh my name is zach
brush i am the co-ceo and co-founder of
recur
really happy to be here special thank
you to the hash team uh for having
having us and for really being great
supporters of recurring early supporters
of us as we embark on our nft journey um
it's really been great uh getting to
know your team and working with you
i wanted to use this chance uh to share
with her's thoughts and our thoughts on
the nft landscape
where we feel nfts are going our role in
it
and
really how we feel community
is what it's all about and how nfts are
this next frontier of digital
communities and how really large ip
corporates
artists creatives musicians whoever will
really utilize nfts as a tool
to bring in their communities make their
communities stronger and really give a
much better and
richer experience to their fan
and
similarly fans will be able to
experience uh a lot more and engage with
like-minded individuals and find
community and find people to engage with
because of nfts so we really see nfts as
this next wave of communication and
community and we're really happy to be a
part of it
one thing that we think is really
important to look into
is is the history of community as it
relates to the digital world
if you look back in the late 90s there
were internet bulletin boards where
people got together
and and shared some of their thoughts
and rallied around different types of
ideas and then from there moved to aol
chat rooms and you were conversing with
people online also about you know
like-minded types of things and as
things went on and you we had reddit and
discord and on reddit there's indexing
different types of communities from
super large communities around some of
the largest ip in the world their ideas
in the world their interests are
musicians to small niche communities but
it was all indexed and you can search it
and find it and find people from all
over the world from all walks of life
that had a similar interest to you and
connect with them and engage with them
and share with them and that's immensely
you know uh
and then from reddit we now have things
like discord where you can actually
communicate and speak to people
so
community becomes this vibrant thing
vibrant thing digitally
and we see nfts as this next step
it's this next frontier of community
engagement uh and
we're right at the at the forefront of
it and at recur what we are doing we
build these white label nft solutions
for some of the world's largest global
ip
with the notion of bringing the fans
together in a place where they can
engage with the brands that they love
but also with fans and like-minded
individuals that also love that and are
able to find and create community
around those types of things
there's a lot of questions of hey are we
in a bubble are nfts
here to stay
we think nfts are going to be a massive
massive massive industry
because they're culturally relevant and
culture defines the world in in front of
us and nfts are also a next step of
culture we're seeing it right now in the
art world how artists are flocking to
this space and sure there is speculation
people are are noticing crypto punks
selling for millions or hundreds of
thousands of dollars people see people's
work of art trading at 69 million
dollars and so many other artists are
coming into the space but what's also
happening is artists are able to
actually monetize for the first time in
a meaningful way barriers to enter them
enter this art market are being broken
down and it's becoming accessible
globally uh and that's what really
crypto is all about is this concept of
accessibility but of course like in any
new asset class there is speculation
there is ebbs and and flows and we try
to look past that speculation with our
approach space
the way we see nfts again goes right
back down to community we want to create
an access point where it's seamless for
people to to access
their favorite and most beloved brands
we want recur to serve as a gateway
to to the metaverse for so many of these
folks and it's our goal to bring one
billion people into the metaverse and
into this into this digital world
nfts
do so many
you know wonderful things for creators
and one of them is this concept of a
recurring royalty at recur we you know
we created and we're part of
an eip that created the royalty standard
across ethereum which means that no
matter where the asset trades
the original ip brand musician artist
that that created that asset gets to
participate in the secondary sales
and this is a really powerful thing that
did not exist exists in in a non-crypto
world truly uh
you know so this
brings a lot of power back into the
hands of crea of the creators and and
we're really excited uh to be part of
that
and as we're looking at the space and
seeing so many new developments from the
successes of crypto punks the successes
of boarded yacht club to so many
wonderful other crypto nft projects that
that are coming out
we ask ourselves
or rather we get asked often
our nft is here to stay
and for us we have not come out with any
of our projects yet and we're so excited
to release them soon but we're working
with the you know most significant uh ip
in the world
and we know those those people are
entering the space
and it's going to make a massive massive
difference the entire crypto community
they're going to bring tons of fans and
tons of people into the ecosystem that
had not previously been in crypto
in a digital ecosystem or had even known
what an nft is right as you look at
different buckets there are people that
know about what an nft is there are
people that know what an nfd is and have
bought an nft and there are people that
just don't even know what an nft is at
all and we think the education process
that is going to start happening soon
with so many large brands entering the
space with more wonderful businesses
starting to build in the ecosystem is
going to really educate uh the wider
range of fans audiences buyers consumers
to really enter this nft ecosystem
and really help create
this robust industry and it's really
really exciting we
also want to encourage people that buy
things
from a recur experience to take that
asset off the platform we're blockchain
agnostic meaning we don't we don't have
our own blockchain we aren't beholding
to any single chain and people can of
course take our nfts off the platforms
that we create and bring it with them to
a metaverse or take it to take it to
openc or to wearable or to another uh
nft exchange or game or application or
whatever it is and engage with it there
and what we really want to happen in in
in that situation is for the for the fan
to go and experience the greater
metaverse to go and spirit the digital
world and we're really excited to be a
part of that so it's really great to be
here um
thanks again for taking the time and
really looking forward to
you guys and
everybody seeing what we have in store
it's such an exciting time for the
crypto community it's a really exciting
time for the nft space and the licensing
community is also super super excited
and we at recur are really excited to be
part of it thanks
my name is edward
i work as a head of growth here at
hashed and hashed is a one of the
largest the fund here in korea we are
actively investing in multiple projects
from d5 to nft
um and um once again um thanks for
participating our event good to be
connected
likewise yeah it's nice to meet you guys
yeah and i'm jason or with this friend a
co-founder of this thread and we are a
blockchain accelerating forum based in
korea
we are helping various blockchain
projects to onboard to korean market and
we are focusing on
content marketing such as blog article
video pr youtube like that
so yeah throughout this event we hope to
a lot of nf project can introduce the
serbs and korean community
to share
their insights on this nft market
yeah
and jeremy could you intro yourself
hi hamish so i'm jamin and i'm also at
this bread together with jason
and i mostly deal with the research and
the current ongoing trends in various
blockchains and
i majorly uh
focus on either ecosystem and other evm
variants
so
mostly i look at the development of dbi
and the ecosystem in general
and
yeah we are really glad to have you here
you must be extremely busy now that
obviously has grown so much
thank you look at jamie's hat that's all
mental mask
oh yeah
yeah guys so um
let's get started so um
um so we have prepared several questions
that people might wonder about so um i
think
you know if if you're a crypto
uh if you're in blockchain i think most
of us um know about what openc is but
just uh giving give our audience a
little bit background of who you are and
what opencs can you please explain about
openc and introduce about yourself as
well
of course yeah so i'm hamish um the
growth and community leader openc and so
i look after sort of our content
marketing uh community team of sort of
customer support agents and i also help
on the business development side like
getting artists on the platform and sort
of showcasing those artists in the best
way we can
um and openc is a marketplace for nfts
the digital goods that i'm sure you've
all heard lots about um
and yeah it's exciting to be challenged
you guys we're growing quickly scaling
the team and
looking to sort of expand around the
world and introduce ourselves to new
users when did you join openc and what
was your um you know
you know motivation that you actually
joined openc in the first place yeah so
i joined in may last year so i was one
of the first people to join who wasn't
sort of a developer like a coder so i
kind of came in to look after the
community building community development
side of the business
and i sort of in the past was working in
the music industry and there were lots
of problems with royalty distribution i
sort of realized that the
way media was exchanged and the way
artists were paid on the internet wasn't
necessarily optimal so the sort of
the opportunity the entities represented
occurred that seemed quite big to me at
the time obviously like the growth has
been pretty extraordinary and i didn't
expect it to necessarily happen this
quickly um but i kind of thought long
term there is a huge opportunity for
here for us to sort of change the way
that artists are rewarded for their work
in an increasingly digital world
and so that was kind of why i was
interested in joining openc
um
so at the time it was more sort of
gaming collectibles which he still is
obviously entities can be anything but
now we've seen the art market kind of
take over recently a little bit and so
that's been really exciting because
exciting things just to see the
different use cases and just come around
people
as people now
open c got cb rounded by anderson hall
ridge at very
1.5 billion value
so now the open sheet became a unicorn
startup is awesome yeah and so how
obviously you could achieve what you are
today and is there any obstacle to
moving forward today of course yeah i
mean so the growth has been pretty rapid
as i mentioned we didn't necessarily
expect it to happen this quickly we
always thought there'd be a moment where
the sort of mainstream public understood
the potential and came to the platform
and that kind of happened at the start
of the year and that was really exciting
we had people like rob gronkowski from
um us athlete we had
us musicians like sean mendes but also
lots of sort of like celebrity figures
from all around the world intrigued
about where these were and that all kind
of happened around the same time and so
that led to this period of huge growth
um
which obviously leads to massive
challenges so scaling the platform
dealing with um
a new whole wave of users
um and hiring has been um challenging
just because you obviously want to keep
standards how you want to hire the right
people but there has to be um some speed
to it to
keep up with demand so obviously raising
a lot of money and having that valuation
is
great for us we're in a privileged
position we have the ability now to
scale the business and hire that talent
that can help take us to the next level
in terms of challenges i've obviously
mentioned hiring
education i think is a huge challenge
like there's so much potential here for
what we're doing but making sure that
the wider world understands the risks
involved with like in interacting with
decentralized platforms
and
understand how to use metamask wallet
what crypto is because there's quite a
lot of
i think for the mainstream culture
there's a little bit of like a
misunderstanding around what that is
exactly so it's down to us in our
position now to to help push move the
needle forward and educate those people
and so that's what we're sort of going
to be focusing on hiring the team
growing um our development resources but
also
making our product really easy to use
and that kind of is what the educational
side is yeah
yeah i totally totally agree with you
that the um education is the key part
for like bringing mass adoption um into
blockchain space um that's why i like
and probably um this bread we are doing
a lot of education works through various
contents you know like videos and we're
also doing a lot of meetups here to
educate people so that they can you know
understand about what blockchain is and
then probably you know you know the
vision that we have together so i i
totally agree with you about the uh
education
nice
so extension to what is jason asked by
you you have been invested by anderson
horowitz and you guys raised
significant amount of capital
in your recent series
so
uh how do you plan to uh
spend this money and invest into what
kind of infrastructure and
what is the long-term vision of opencv
with this kind of funding
yeah good questions i think the the idea
is for us to invest in the community
because we're at the heart of this
growing community there's so many
amazing platforms all around us other
entity marketplaces art houses gallery
spaces metaverse and
virtual worlds and decentralized crypto
voxels all these amazing platforms we
just intend to try and grow the space
for all of those platforms all of this
ecosystem i think the way we can best do
that is just by making sure we're the
best nft marketplace we can possibly be
and we can support their assets their
different types of metadata all their
different needs and so that we can make
sure that they can communicate with
their users too and they can
have their users trade their entities
from their little worlds on our platform
so i think there are a few ways we do
that one of them is multi-chain
um bringing in different blockchains to
the platform making sure that we're the
go-to platform it doesn't matter if the
nfts are on clayton
polygon or another nf or another
blockchain like flow for example we want
to be sort of that house
for all nfts across the market obviously
that sort of thing takes time we'd love
it to happen tomorrow but that's not
necessarily gonna gonna be the case so
we have to prioritize where we see where
the market opportunity is on that front
um but i think how we get to these these
places is just hiring really great
talent um on the marketing side the
business development side the community
side and obviously the engineering side
if we can scale our team effectively
then we can put a proper roadmap in
place which we already have um to sort
of
to make these things possible um
so that is sort of like that's the
twofold plan hire the best talent we can
get the
other blockchains uh integrated educate
our users on how to sort of enter this
world
and then when we feel that we're in a
place where the products is definitely
ready for another push towards
mainstream adoption that's when we'll
sort of turn on the marketing spends and
look to bring in those new users and
because at the moment i think if we did
that it feels
that we're going through like a nice
period of organic growth and we don't
necessarily need right now to push that
too far because the product
i think we're all aware still needs a
bit of attention and there are sort of
teething issues that are always always
going to happen when you grow at this
speed and so we just need to get that
the platform ready for that next period
of growth which is the intention
yeah so um
now the opposite got trade volume about
three billion in august yeah i think it
was it is crazy yeah because
the trading volume in july was just uh
three three hundred million that is now
the ten multiple yeah
so what caused this volume to exploit
and how many sales and users are there
now
yeah so i think it's it's a good
question actually because we did have a
lot of like
interest from that sort of mainstream
public in sort of march april may and
that was a sort of
a driver of that volume at that time but
that
and those things are still happening
there's still people entering from like
with huge audiences wanting to sell
enough to use we're still seeing a lot
of that
but i suspect that a lot of this volume
is coming from the people that were
always not integrated in the space and
understand entities and want us to
engage with it and so for example
and the volume figures are obviously
great but i think what's more um
interesting perhaps is that we've
had over 1.5 million unique um trades on
the platform last month which is more
than all of our previous months combined
so it's not just that like prices are
going up which equals more volume i
think it's actually that there are there
are more trades happening on the
platform um which makes that um
makes that quite interesting metric and
we also have now
over 200 thousand active traders on the
platform so that's not just people who
visit if there's like lots more visitors
to the site and lots more people who are
curious but these are people are
actually trading and making use of the
platform um so i think there's
a few reasons why that's happening but
obviously it'll be interesting to see
what happens next month whether that
sort of volume keeps up and those trades
that trading number keeps up too
yeah thanks uh that's a really
interesting topic in fact so because now
there is a another nfd exchange called
readable where
it tries to leverage its token economics
with users participation to the platform
usage itself
and we all know that openc doesn't have
it or doesn't have it yet but so
uh we'd like to hear from you like what
kind of competitive edge do you have
against other notable nft marketplaces
like nifty gateway
there's nifty gateway known origin
foundation and many others so
what do you think uh what really makes
openc really special even without this
working token economics
yeah interesting um so i think with
super air um foundation nifty gateway
those sort of platforms i view opencv
quite differently to those platforms
just because we're in like an open
marketplace and anyone at any time can
put an nft on openc and try and set it
um so that's a key differentiator for us
foundation and super and all those sort
of platforms it's more it's more curated
like they decide which nfts go on the
platform they can like they have invite
systems so it feels a bit more exclusive
and those companies are hugely
successful in their own right i'm sure
they'll go on to be even more successful
in the future in their particular our
specific world we also have their
nft is on openc2 because we're like a
marketplace so we have a storefront for
all of those um
different sort of companies that you
mentioned variable like viewers being a
little bit more similar to openc and
that they are more of a marketplace but
they're still
a little bit more art focused than us or
historically have been i don't
necessarily
it's hard to pinpoint exactly what our
competitive edge is because obviously we
have had more like traction and interest
in sales volume recently than they have
they're also a great platform they've
helped us sort of move the space forward
together with them um
but i think being the first mover is a
huge advantage we
launched our platform a long time before
we ever did so i think that brand trust
does come in there we've also made user
safety like a priority on the platform
like trying to get ahead of those issues
that come about in a decentralized world
and
which i'm not saying that i haven't done
but we've really focused on that and
tried to make sure our users understand
that too so maybe that's maybe that's
something that's worked for us and we
also focus usually on listening to the
community and we get lots and lots of
feedback and some of it good some of it
bad like any other company we always try
and listen to that understand how people
are feeling because we understand as
well that we won't be successful without
our community and without those users so
listening to their feedback
communicating with them effectively
um
yeah has been really important
very interesting answer because
yeah basically what you're saying is
that being a first mover and being a
decentralized
exchange for energy training and minting
is one of the huge advantage over
nifties and other exchanges which are a
little
ah yeah so
and that also calls for a problem i
guess because since the platform is
entirely centralized so there should be
some malicious behavior
over the
nfts or the content of the nft people
trying to meet such as
some artworks or some kind of brand
might get
a branch in terms of the trademarks or
copyrights so
does opencv have any measures to
actually stop that from happening
yeah so i think this is a theorist issue
something we take very seriously um
we're conscious of our like
responsibility within the space to make
sure that all those safeguarding
measures are as good as they can be
um and to educate users on the risks
involved obviously we have sort of
verification processes in place we also
have a user safety team which is growing
and monitoring the platform
and we're looking to introduce some
tooling that um
can like detect images so if an image is
already on our platform and someone
mints the same image that will just be
immediately flagged to us and we can
remove it um also with sort of things
like copyright and
regulation you obviously follow every
regulation to the latter we're open to
working with regulators to make sure
we're compliant in every single
territory um so if there's like a
company that reached out to us asking us
to remove content that infringes on
their ib will of course comply and do
that
um but yeah it is it is an issue but
also we we understand the challenges
ahead and we're like working
now to make sure that if there is
another growth period where like there's
more ip coming onto the platform there's
more interest we're ready for that and
we don't get sort of surprised by it so
we're putting in lots of different
structures like automated technologies
that can detect fraud for example
and growing our user safety team to
actively monitor the platform and remove
stuff before it's reported to us
and just make sure artists and
collectors feel protected because that
is ultimately
our responsibility and our end goal that
people can feel like they can safely
trade on the platform without worrying
about
the fact that they're in a decentralized
world and the fact that it's their
responsibility to do these checks and
education is a huge thing as well so if
you buy an item that opens your team
hasn't approved or verified the
collection we will give you a quite a
big warning that says this collection
was made two days ago there's been no
trades please check social media for
example to see if this is the right
contract address
i click here to accept our terms and
conditions i understand that i'm
purchasing this at my own risk so we are
we're trying to get ahead of these
things and educate people as well
a few days ago there has been a
seemingly prank by somebody claiming
that this is the artwork of banksia i am
the pizza
yeah so what's your take on that
it was interesting francie is obviously
um usually influential figure in the
space i
don't actually know about all of the
context there and exactly what happened
but i did see i did see what was going
on on twitter and i saw it asking about
it
i didn't understand how they
managed to
get get the dnft on banksy's website it
must have been yeah so
so there was the interesting part so the
the pranker actually had his uh
biography to be the link that leads to
uh the real banksy's
bibliographic website
where
where the link takes the person to that
kind of uh exactly the same image as the
crypto punk a person actually uploaded
so many people actually perceive
that this guy must be the bank taxi
himself because the
link that he is taking them to actually
leads to banksy's website so
people saw the legitimacy in there but
then it turns out that the uh prankster
somehow smartly gotten
that uh website grasp to be
somewhat uh exploited so
i think that's what happened really
yeah it's an interesting one i guess
it's like a
an indicator of the risks involved in
this sort of trading as an indication of
the education that needs to go on i'm
not i fancy obviously is very aware of
like everything that goes on in this
entity's face if anyone's educated on
this is him but i also think that
he would have learned from that as well
and like he would have seen the warnings
on the open seas page saying this hasn't
been reviewed this collection was made
yesterday all those things i talked
about he would have clicked the button
saying i accept on trading my own risk
so
with that in mind
i guess people just need to be even more
cautious about the fact that websites
can be exploited
um
but yeah i think it's one of those it's
an interesting one like in the future
maybe if banksy did come to us we would
try and verify that with him but in a
free in a free decentralized world there
are going to be challenges and we just
have to be equipped to overcome them as
they arise
sure
i was gonna i saw that uh banksy art on
the uh it's a fake one but you know on
the open scene i was gonna join the bid
but you know
that was a uh
yeah i i i should be more cautious
yeah as you to say
it isn't
it's a tricky one but um if you if you
feel like
you have that like social validation
from an artist for example they
published the link and they've said this
is coming from me
there shouldn't really be
yeah
so um i have a question so um as an open
platform on blockchain i think agent
touched um on this topic a bit uh i
assume uh fair governance uh is
essential for obesity's future
and what so having said that what's the
team's role in the platform's governance
and what's the user's role in this as
well so do you plan to make the user
more accountable to openc's future
governance as well
yeah interesting and i don't know
there's no plans at the moment for a
sort of governance token that may change
in the future but at the moment there's
no plans at all for that um in terms of
community governance we want to find
ways to make it more democratic we want
the users involved at every turn
they are at the moment the users are
involved um in unofficial ways at every
point we're listening to their feedback
we're asking directly for their thoughts
on the products how we can move it
forward which artists we should be
shining a light on when we get the
opportunity so i think we need to work
with them in the future
um to
ensure that they understand how
important they are to us because we we
want people to know that i think people
do know that but obviously with other
platforms having tokens there is
sometimes this element of oh well why
are we being rewarded in the way that
users on other platforms are and we
understand that but in our like short
term future a token isn't necessarily
right for what we're building but there
are probably other ways that we can
introduce that sort of form of
governance informal sort of um user and
sort of community involvement so we're
going to find ways to do that whether
it's sort of
community competitions to see who gets
on the home page to be featured for
example or things like that or if we
have like five up-and-coming new
features we can ask them on twitter or
discord like which of these do you want
us to prioritize we already do stuff
like that anyway but if we can make that
more formal and more efficient and like
there'd be user rewards for getting
involved participation that would be
great too
um so yeah the answer is at the moment
there's not any formal plans for
governance models but it is hugely
important for us that users know that
they're valued and feel involved in the
future
we know that the latest hard fork
actually introduced eid
1559 which actually calls for
ex as for excessive transaction demand
is coming up then the gas price itself
would basically increase exponentially
and these eats are to be burned
and a lot of people actually welcome
this change in a way that because now it
gets burned and
it's becoming ultra sound money and etc
but then what's happening currently is
that thanks to this nft beaver that we
are currently
experiencing
many people actually playing open c on
this part right why why this gas fields
are skyrocketing and when we actually
see the gas panthers on either skin io
then it is always open see at the top
you guys are the uh
the biggest gas scheduler in a way so
and a lot of people also at the same
time blame for the bots
who actually beats on
a specific way that actually exploits on
actual uh human users would have made a
fair bid if not else what wasn't there
so
what is your take on this problem
uh so
how do you actually
stop bots or can you even stop them if
you cannot stop them what can you do
yeah interesting so i think
that
it's kind of
it's a tricky one to answer because we
we're aware of some bots and we i think
there are some that we're working with
to make sure that they're like operating
within the framework for example we have
an api which is free for everyone in the
industry to use and lots of other
companies in the industry do use it to
display entities
but that
free information that we have out there
for other people to use can be used in
and it also depends on how you look at
it is it negative or is it usually
positive for like liquidity for artists
and all that sort of thing so there is
like one argument that suggests that is
helping trading is helping artists um
build their careers what sort of stuff
on the other side you could say
it's an exploitation of the system so
we're trying to put in like a framework
for
how we view acceptable use for our api
um and we're distributing api keys to
people who sort of comply with those um
issues in terms of sort of
overly aggressive bots we have been
blocking that recently we've been
stopping that um on our api like banning
access to certain ip addresses
api keys we don't like doing that we
don't really like policing the market
because we are an open economy but
sometimes you have to do that if there
is malicious behavior ongoing but it is
a challenge that we sort of acknowledge
and
confronting i'm trying to work with
these developers to ensure that it's
happening in the right way
thank you hamish i always wondered about
this problem
oh so my last question is the simple but
or hard question
that
how do you think
this enough space in long term and where
we are going
so how will people using this nfd in the
future
yeah i mean good question it's hard one
to answer as you say um but i see there
being more utility involved in nfts in
the future obviously collectibles are
great because people love collecting
like fine art
and sports items that
human beings love collecting and it that
can be digital that can be physical and
i think it will be huge in the future
then at least but i also think things
like tickets to events for example
royalties for music
and things like that there'll be more as
this space grows and as as people
understand the potential i think
there'll be more utility-based nfts and
also i think the metaverse is going to
explode i think digital fashion within
metaverses and like people's identity
online um is already becoming a huge
thing we've seen it with like profile
pictures on twitter for example but i
think that's the first step of what that
kind of looks like and then if you take
that into crypto voxels or something
space and there's those
spaces that develop with the technology
we'll see
lots more interesting things going on in
the fashion world we'll see big brands
from the fashion world
um doing shows and these metaverses
which is already kind of happening but
we'll just see way more of that um and
then there'll be a little bit more
in my view
um sort of interaction with the physical
world too so there'll be a lot more
unlocking of experiences maybe it's like
a immediate concert or you actually can
redeem
like a digital clothing piece of
clothing for a physical piece of
clothing if you have a certain qr code
on your nfc and your metaphor on your
metamask wallet um so i think we're an
exciting point now there's been lots of
innovation things like generative art
we're seeing people develop smart
contracts that actually the smart
contract itself develops the art not the
the person controlling the sort of the
algorithm which is like hugely
interesting so that feels like something
only just at the start of and there's no
reason why that can't happen in music
too so if you've got these genitive art
collectibles
um hugely popular on the site why can't
that happen in the music world and what
does that mean for the future of music
too if music can be like generated by an
algorithm does that change the way
artists in the physical music world
interact with their digital um fans and
all that sort of stuff so there is so
much potential we're very early but as
the technology develops i think we'll
see
some things that we can't even really
imagine now
yeah i couldn't agree with you more i
mean you know especially on you know
you know the metaverse is already
happening
um right now you know the thing is that
i guess i just i believe you know you
know like facebook you know you know
messenger services like kakao talk or
whatsapp i mean these services already
have some kind of you know metaphors
elements as well right so we
we didn't we didn't realize until now
because we call it as natavas right now
and then um i think yeah
you know
i think um year after years i think um
more people will live and now metabolism
as well as we have seen in the film
called you know ready player one by
uh directed by steven spielberg i i love
that movie and then um you know i i
imagine once i uh wake up in the morning
and then i just you know
wear my vr and then
you know you know do a lot of stuffs in
the uh in the digital world
i guess um that's the uh
you know the future that we're going to
live in very soon um very soon yeah
and hopefully um ash and d spread and
open c will play a significant role in
the metaphors as well i mean that was
great yeah
so one last question i mean this is my
personal question as well so you
mentioned that you are planning to
integrate some other blockchain layers
as well
can you tell me can tell us
you know more about you know what are
these uh blockchain layers that you are
planning to integrate with
yeah of course so we
currently have an integration with
polygon um ongoing uh we're sort of in a
sort of better phase of that where or
better phase where we sort of we've
launched it people are using it um but
also we're getting feedback from the
community we're sort of not
marketing it or advertising it too much
at the moment because we understand that
there are certain issues or certain ways
that could be better um and that's all
about like going back to your point
about open sea guzzling all the all of
the gas um that's kind of one the
solution to that is polygon trading is
they have meta transactions so it's just
very we're gonna swallow we're gonna pay
all of the gas fees for our users on
polygon network so the sp is on polygon
like fraction a fraction of what they
are on each but we'll just be covering
those small costs so users can trade and
create entities for free so we we feel
like once that marketplace is up and
running properly and people are using
that as the primary marketplace on opc
uh that will make a huge difference to
trading on the platform because at the
moment obviously with the nfd market
prices are quite high because they need
to be quite high because the gas price
is quite high so if you you don't want
to buy an item for one dollar if you're
going to pay 30 gas fee so we feel like
with polygon network and sort of free
trading like no gas fees no transaction
fees that will enable lots of lower
level
trades so that 1.5 million trades in a
month might
go up significantly because people can
trade one dollar entities at a time
without worrying about a big gas fee
that's kind of one of our
priorities there we're also thinking
about integrating with other blockchains
like flow for example um and i'm sure
there are lots of others i'm not
mentioning like teslas um but
i think at the moment we're prioritizing
site reliability just because in this
last month we have
it's been another staggering month of
growth as we can all see from the public
um
the public uh charts and we're also
seeing lots more website visitors as
well so that is just quite a challenge
for our development team i actually
personally believe that we're doing
quite well to handle this 10 times
traffic um
but we need to just make sure that we
are super reliable for our users and
we're kind of constantly
up the website is constantly faster even
if next month we have 50 times more
users we're ready for that so we're like
that's our priority at the moment and
then once we feel like we have that in
place that site reliability and we're
ready to scale however much we're going
to scale the next year then after that
we'll go back to prioritizing our
integrations with other blockchains
so since this is called korean nfc road
show do you have any other um do you
have any comments or
any um you know kind words for the
korean audience here
of course of course yeah i mean i'm
always fascinated by my career i'd love
to come to seoul one day um but
obviously i think within the wider world
korea is known especially within the
cryptocurrencies basically it's known to
be offered about innovation and
interesting things within blockchain and
crypto so it's really like a pleasure
for
myself and the opencv team to get the
opportunity to chat to you guys your
sort of very established organizations
in korea and to chat your audience and
hopefully spread the word about entities
within the korean market which i already
know it's
huge and hugely passionate about
entities and we have lots of korean uses
so yeah it's a privilege for me to get
the opportunity to chat with you
sounds good thanks thank you for the
comments anyway um thanks thank you very
much um any other comments jason jamin
you're all good uh thanks for your time
and your input
and your answers to our questions so
yeah i guess by watching this video
korean people might have a better idea
as to what opencv is actually up to and
what is actually happening around in the
overall ft ecosystem thank you
nice no it's just a pleasure to chat to
you guys really nice to meet you
yeah thank you amish thank you bye
bye guys
[Music]
[Music]
objective today is to kind of discuss
let each other carbons are very readily
seen blockchain information nowadays we
met a lot of petitions in Korea and
their real mind
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
what you see out that the current
Sparkle had pretty much geocentric this
presents a huge opportunity for our
market architecture
so we hydro X X square has started to
build and develop already you know in
the market right now is to be layer 2 we
did it dynamic
[Music]
you
all right so the next project Oh is in
the beauty industry oh yeah
with over two million monthly active
users they closed out the 2017 fiscal
year with forty four million dollars in
revenue so who is or in many ways was
responsible for bringing a beauty to the
Chinese audience I want you to please
welcome home on song founder and CEO of
voice how most amoeba thank
everyone yeah I'm here to talk about
Beauty there's no question that beauty
is growing and it is one of the most
profitable industry in globally in
global scape China Korea states I think
the reason the reason for it is high
probability is that because this is
mainly ladies business it's not hard it
is not easy to deal with ladies I'm
quite sure about that however in this
beauty market there are some problems
the reason is there are so many fake
data there are so many dishonest
contents that distracts participants for
individual customers and companies in
the customer side there are billions of
ladies and gentlemens creates Beauty
contents
however like 1% 0.1% limited people get
incentive for generating those contents
even though they are contributing this
platform second there are so many
dishonest data and sponsored experience
that distracts a actual experience of
customers so customers get confused
in the company side yes I sell cosmetics
however it is not easy to actually break
down into the very deep stream and find
out what what was our marketing
efficiency were they do a lot of brand
marketing they do product marketing in
different channels and combined they
don't know which is much more efficient
secondly cosmetic companies are
currently having hard times to acquire
data is very essential data to make a
very good profits to make a very good
products
the reason is data there has no like
one-dimensional or two-dimensional sets
of data that can actually give insights
to the companies that make products and
thirdly it's also really hard to make a
target approach to the customers
Facebook Instagram they do provide a
rate good advertisement product however
we don't think that's enough and we
don't think that's the end of this
beauty sector so what we are trying to
do in this cosmic chain is in our
platform we are going to redistribute
the ownership and the management
authority of the beauty related datas
and beauty related contents by rewarding
participants at the level of very keen
and systematic incentive system
so it's pretty much simple step one
mainly ladies users comes into our
platform cause my chain platform and
they enjoy it they watch video they buy
products they can also participate in
surveys and it's it's going to much much
funner and it's going through much more
excitement and it's going to be a place
where ladies can actually learn about
how to use the product when to use
certain products where to buy it
so users participate in this platform
just for fun obviously they do get
rewards by participation it's going to
be in a very systematic way for the D
word in this process
nextly we costume change is going to
collect all those kind of datas number
one it's going to be very basic profiles
skin types skin problems nationality
male/female age it's going to be a very
key assets that can provide very
fundamental data's for companies
secondly it's going to be about what
kind of Beauty contents that certain or
specific customer actually consumes or
like or write the comments on third is
going to be about the purchase data or
usage data certain title products which
brands when they buy it how often all
these main three data sets will be going
to be collected and discussed much in
platform these data sets will be used by
and is going to be paid by certain
businesses that are going to be also
participants of this cost machine
platform for the businesses who makes
products so
when they need ideation they can do a
open survey if they need us some
feedback from customers they can open
also a feedback chat rooms and also for
the marketing's brand companies it's
going to be much more sophisticated
advertisement platform for sales
marketplace tens thousands of brand
company will be loved to join this Cosmo
chain platform let me show you some
examples here the first years case it's
a list of the company in Korea just
about 22 it's mainly makeup companies so
I don't use tools on 22 however when
they want to come up with new let's say
a lipstick what kind of colors what kind
of okay it's literally mixed up yeah
we'll go this one so if if it's it's
pretty much simple so let's say a
company wants to make up a new lipstick
a new product every sets of collective
data can be achieved in this platform
and all the individual participants who
are willingly going to provide the data
will be gain gain a reward for this can
you move back once more sure yeah and
also when it comes to marketing we are
going to be able to provide at which
stage the customer actually saw the
advertisement on the base of the content
also what kind of product and what kind
of product information that individuals
were locked in so we are able to provide
much more accurate and we are able to
provide much more efficient marketing
platforms for the
other topic is about marketplace
obviously there are strong needs for the
companies to actually sell the products
to the customers and it's all about
targeting it's all about targeting
segmentation and because we have much
more sophisticated data about the
purchase contents consumption and the
rate based profiles we will be able to
provide much more efficient ways to
actually sell the products to the
customers in order to make all these
examples happening happen we provide so
this is our token model so basically we
have coin it's going to be every word
it's going to be a token and also it's
called cosmic coin and within the
platform we are going to reward our
participants by cosmic power power coin
is obviously going to be convertible and
also there is going to be a one more
index called customer level which means
that cosmic power can be used in the
marketplace and it's going to be can be
converted to the coin however level is
going to be the like net acquisition
about the custom power which stands for
the total contribution level for each
participants and in order to make our
platform much much expand faster and
larger we are at this stage inviting a
lot of partnerships such as Beauty
contents platforms and brand companies
advertisement companies and para
research companies
or in the global scale our main focus is
going to be China
States and Korea our strategy is pretty
much straightforward we are going to
make a platform we are going to have a
lot of partnerships in in every values
in every relevant aspect and combining
all those customer data and reward that
rewarding our individual participants
with our coins we believe that we can
actually achieve a much more
sophisticated
in this beauty sector
oh hello it's me Bob okay so because we
have more time than we expected so I'll
ask several prepared questions to you
and I will get the questions from the
audience's as well is it okay with you
guys okay my first question is how did
you first get excited about bullying
games and what was your motivation on
that I feel like I answered this already
in my presentation well I did the same
 cryptokeys right yeah I mean I
guess I can say even from before that my
interest in training games and training
game assets has been there for really
really long time so I actually traded
for example Diablo 3 even when the real
money auction house was released I love
that i lo a lot of people actually
didn't like that and the hablo too as
well so traded a lot of those type of
items so I feel like it was a very
natural fit for me to just start loving
n of T is and trading of game items
pretty fast
I discovered blockchain game and through
crypto Kitty's like pretty much everyone
in the space but as I mentioned in our
presentation I've been in the user
generated content space for seven years
with this franchise of sandbox and for
us the main benefits that blockchain is
bringing essentially this true ownership
of the user creation made easily a lot
of sense since we could see people
devote themselves invest time and effort
to create amazing content and never been
properly retributive or being able to
take the value out of previews even our
previous platform and start monetizing
anywhere else so when the idea of
allowing that finally through the
centralization came that's where it
became really excited for us yeah I mean
I think we share the same its crypto
Kitty's right but I think the maybe to
us to add on this one
cryptokeys showed us about digital
scarcity but the discovery that content
could become a platform and actually
changed the way we discover content I
think that's something that really in
anyone who's an indie game developer is
going to feel sort of some hope because
right now they can't be discovered and
this is kind of why we are extra excited
about this potential to speak about the
scarcity of the approaching games so
personally do you guys own crypto assets
like blockchain game items or the
cryptocurrencies yeah I have I mean yeah
I have multiple cats and also crypto
MLB's and some other now some cheese
wizards actually recently released so I
just yeah I think everyone needs some
entities in their wallets because as I
mentioned it's the start of your like
virtual identity the way I see it so
this is history
and I even have some worthless ones from
failed icos which I will not sell but
just keep as memories for when I was
like mementos so yeah I own like a
couple of crypto kitties or a couple of
axes more recently a mystique one she's
wizard etc I don't stream usually but I
started to post on Twitter short videos
and when I actually buy them so like I
can share the overall experience of
buying it with people in my network and
I found out like more I speak and I
fertilized by NFT the more in my network
people were not interested to blockchain
they get interested into it so I think
the effort is paying off and I'm also
doing that internally with all my team
where I give them just maybe 0.1 0.2
eater like less than $50 and I tell them
okay bio cryptokey by an acci and they'd
love the experience so that's I think
part of it they probably love the
experience of owning it not maybe the
experience of setting up the wallet
right
yeah I think so I mean other than the
sort of mandatory crypto kitties I have
to buy some axiom finiti indeed but is
is I think the the thing what I would
look at we have made some more of our
own first and if T's with them are
existing games as well like a star girl
as we're experimenting scouring through
open sea I actually you know I think the
story is when we first launched a
nonsense nft just to try it out on open
sea we sold like 20 eath worth of stuff
and we're like why would someone buy
this right that doesn't make sense
there's no game there's no background
nothing why would you buy an NF t of an
item that doesn't even have a white
paper or a story and I actually think to
your point about the worthless entities
there is a market for being first right
and you are at an early adopter stage
you know there's only 20 of them it may
be worthless but it is one of the very
first n if T's ever made and so that
aspect so basically what I'm saying is
you should all think about buying lots
of entities right now don't miss we
first remember that as I mentioned in my
presentation the approaching games can
be categorized into two types so one has
its own tokens and and not so what are
your thoughts on talking games that
release their own tokens and those which
do not sure well we're really in an
early stage of blockchain gaming so no
one really knows what works or what not
it's too early to just base the future
on the success of one or few existing
games
I think each game has to design its own
gameplay game mechanics and think about
whether adding a token of their own and
then build a good token economy on top
of it makes sense or not for the purpose
of Turkey if it's just about adding a
token for the sake of adding a token and
it has no utility or the token precision
will decrease and it will not make
revenue but in our case controlling the
supply of sand making
sure that is going to be in demand
through the sale of our content and it
has more utility than just a mean of
payments like transaction it does made
sense and that choice we took yeah so
for our sake I was actually very much
against having our own talking for a
very long time just because I believe
firmly that most ERC 20s are useless
tokens people have created useless
for way too long and the things that we
needed to do was ask sebastian is saying
create a really solid ecosystem around
this type of token so for our sake I
didn't mention it in our in my
presentation but we also have a lunar
token which is coming which is going to
fuel the in-game ecosystem basically
allowing people to earn this lunar token
when they're playing the game and you
can then stake the luminal token to
participate in the value that is being
created by the network and I think these
kind of fundamental strategies are
important if you are going to create
your own token I don't necessarily
believe in having a stable currency
because you have for example diet that
you can use for that but what you need
is to create demand for the token that
you are created having in your own
ecosystem and that is not an easy task
so I think that the people who have
created a token ecosystem right now it's
really hard you need to spend a lot of
time thinking about it and then you
can't do it in a good way
yeah so I think in general you know if
you consider doing a token in your game
one of the things you also have to
consider is a regulatory framework right
so doing a token even though it's a
utility token in the game doesn't mean
that it is okay to do it because the
regulator's may look at it and say well
we think this could be a security token
an example in the u.s. if you issue a
token but the utility is not established
they will consider that a security token
because it becomes speculative in nature
right now that depends on which country
you do it right so those are aspects so
actually launching a project with a
security tow I was a with a utility
token that has not yet got an actual
utility
put your project even at risk
potentially just because regulators
might come all over it that's one aspect
but the other thing is you know I would
say is that every game has a different
economy whether you choose to make a
token or not they're not directly
interoperable right within the terms of
a currency so you know we don't believe
in one currency fits all because like in
sandbox there's a particular utility
with ax C there's a particular utility
but there will be a place where the two
tokens can exchange so I do think in a
framework where the regulatory framework
is well established which it isn't at
the moment I think in the future we will
have thousands of tokens right because
every game can be a token and can be
exchangeable balanced in the way that
makes sense for their particular game
economy some blocks in games create
their own NFT marketplace inside of the
game on the other hand there are shared
marketplaces like open C so what is your
prospect on these two different
marketplaces maybe I'll start first
right and we do yeah so you know I think
there's many marketplaces to look at
generally speaking once you own the NFT
it can travel anywhere around and that's
the point
however I think this was the point made
earlier is that when you do the
marketplace inside your own game you
give it an experience that is unique
right you can capture the marketplace
experience that makes sense
for the gameplay you have in mind which
means also then when you do a
marketplace it doesn't have to be it
doesn't have to look like a marketplace
right it could be you know inside a
treasure chest it could be in a menu it
doesn't really matter right every game
will have its different flavor now where
third-party marketplaces are really
important is it's not just just like
with Amazon today in the physical world
you sometimes list your product on
Amazon not because you want to sell more
in Amazon but you want to be discovered
because there's an audience there
already that's buying right so you know
we'll just like with a Formula One
auction yes we did obviously do a lot of
promotion to put on our marketplace but
they got a lot of attention on open sea
as well because all the other people on
open sea
looking at this crazy car and saying
what is going on here and in itself
becomes an event so I think more market
places is part of the education well
pretty much things say the marketplace
are acting as those new discovery
platform more specifically to the
sandbox project because we are
user-generated content it was important
to be our primary marketplace because
that's where all the tokenization of
happens so unlike some other blockchain
game and for example I've seen V right
now or not all the tokens are being made
by the game developer in our case is the
user so we have to provide user flow and
experience where it's very easy and we
can control all the different aspects of
the experience to upload your content
and make it a token yeah so from my
perspective I believe as has been stated
here that content is king and for that
specific reason I also I believe that it
could be hard for open C and other
marketplaces to defend common
marketplace just because the users will
go to the games and the games can
actually capture other verticals so if
you're a game and have a lot of users
who are using your game you can then
start acting as a distribution platform
for other similar games so they can even
use your own platform so and at that
point you come and say ok but what can
actually open C and other marketplaces
provide let's say that they are not
specialized in gaming they are
specialized in being a marketplace for
100,000 million different things well
maybe they don't fit your niche maybe
don't have the users that you do right
so as gaming specialists we can actually
provide an ecosystem for gamers right
and then we can allow other games for
example to use our marketplace in the
future but maybe to add to this point do
you think then that it makes sense to
put any of T's in your marketplace that
are not important or operable with the
AXI universe that could be I mean so
from from my perspective it's all going
to be about who do we actually want to
work with in the future so I believe in
curation and I believe the curation is
going to be so important in a world
where
everyone has so many choices so if we
can act as curators and make kind of a
decision for our players and say that
yes we can be not the launch pad but say
that this is a game that we put our
stamp of approval on then we can
potentially even do other listings for
them right because it's all about
controlling the users or having no
controlling is a bad word but actually
having the users using your platform so
maybe I think I think definitely agree
that there will be other entities in our
own marketplaces I do think however to
add value to the community it should be
an N of T that is interoperable within
the same universe and it's more
meaningful to the consumer of course I
mean that that's that's a thing but so
what I see is that even if things don't
have direct value in your own world it
could just be a specific kind of brand
or anything a small thing right anything
that gives additional value to the users
well they're gonna be coupling that up
they love that anything that makes you
feel special it's the social proof
that's all what it's about what are some
some of the technical or non-technical
obstacles you have faced when you build
the game on top of the blockchain yeah
so I mentioned aetherium and I would say
that from AXI we started building very
early on in 2018 we built our game based
on the limitations of aetherium that's
why you needed to select your team they
were opponent did the same you send the
gas transaction and well it's just a
disaster
it doesn't work - to actually build a
game based on the etherium limitation so
you kind of need what we think is used a
more hybrid approach it turns out the
users don't really care that much about
decentralization
but that's our like what we have to do
as game developers take kind of a
proactive approach there and let them
have a good user experience while still
maintaining enough decentralization and
probably even going more into a
decentralized aspect in the future so
that's what we have as our experience
I think in a general way coming from
mobile gaming space adding blockchain to
the overall technical stack is already
quite a challenge by itself due to the
yaw of the environment and the
development tools and it's an extra
layer of development that you put on top
of it
more specifically the development of the
implementation of years 1155 since not
yet a standard and it's been submitted
rejected submitted rejected and it's
still pending approval from the
community and even though we are one of
the top free contributor on on it it
takes a lot of time and energy from the
own focus of building our platform and
game that we dedicate to the community
so in a sense it's great but on the
other side then it's time it's less time
you spent on your own product so I think
it's one of the challenge maybe not a
hurdle but definitely a challenge so I
think you know outside of the technical
challenges which have been discussed
I think the UX experience and Mon
boarding people who have made games but
not blockchain games is really a
paradigm shift in designing a game right
so you're completely changing the
environment you're thinking of a game
normally or you can issue as many items
as you want scarcity is not part of your
original design adding sort of Co value
right is not part of the design and now
they have to think about that you know
when when when we were thinking about
the auction for the very first one the
traditional game designers were like
well you know we should basically expect
maybe $10 or $20 or $30 because they
were thinking in traditional game models
right and while we did not expect
$100,000 we were hoping for tens of
thousands of dollars right because of
the fact that was formula one and so
what are you selling you're not actually
now selling sort of mass items anymore
right you've gone from selling you know
mass consumer goods into special rare
items so you're thinking you're
designing has to put that into mind and
into the interchange that has actually
been our biggest challenge
getting a game designer who's worked on
games all their life in a certain sort
of top-down way and asking them
essentially to change that that has been
one of our biggest challenges I would I
would just like to add that actually
infinity we're not traditional game
designers we actually never created a
game before which i think is an
advantage in this point because
everything that we do has been focused
on how we can utilize the blockchain to
our advantage and it turns out that when
we see a traditional game company's
Studios coming into the space they are
really struggling because they don't
they aren't used to thinking in these
like crypto ways pretty much like you
need to align the incentives and think
very much about the economical
implications of everything that you do
because if you fail and issue too many
tokens well everything is useless it's
just a simple economic ecosystem that
was my last question that prepared so uh
I'm gonna get questions from the
audience's right now if you have
questions please raise your hand all
right so my question is about
interoperability so like I think that
there's two ways that it could work you
either have the item that's moving
depreciate in value you have the item
maintaining value but I think that this
will piss off either of the gamers
because he appreciate the value of the
item then the person will not move their
game to another game because it's not
gonna have much value but if you
maintain the value of the item let's say
for example in God's Unchained the item
Hyperion was just lose its value and
people who are actually oh the adapters
would be pretty pissed off and also you
talked about pay to earn that will also
kind of lose its value because now we
have a lot more people who's competing
for that spot and there's a this
imbalance of item values so how was your
going to navigate that especially from
your developing experience maybe I can
ask this question you're saying that
because there's interoperability the
item will lose value yeah so um I guess
it's the gamers decision because you
talked about how the gamers will make
the game items to bring the gamers in
about how the developers a game
developer yes yeah so it's really the
game developers choice
whether they're going to appreciate the
values item or maintain the values item
but it's like a lot of legendary items
flowing into one game they makes the
game developer of the original game in a
really tough situation so the I mean
others will have a comment but my first
comment on this one is that the item
isn't there's what means that the
scarcity of that item is not their
decision so they can't replicate it even
if they choose to take the Hyperion card
and make it worth very little inside
their game that doesn't change the fact
that it is the only Hyperion card out
there that has a certain value right now
my view is that if I'm a game developer
and I'm gonna use a super expensive item
is it in my interest to devalue it or is
it in my interest to actually make it
more valuable so that that community
joins right so the value of the
community is I want the gods and chain
community in this case to come play my
game I don't want to piss them off right
that's why I'm doing it so it's a little
bit like you know how do I bring in the
Ferrari community certainly not by
making them feel like a Ferrari is a
Fiat even though the same company right
but you want to make sure that the
experience is good then you get the
community if the conspiracies bad they
won't go and the game developer will
have made effort to integrate an item
that nobody will go to so we think about
we think that is naturally balancing
each other out because the incentives
are aligned yeah I I agree with him
there but I would also like to add that
what's interesting is from a game
developers perspective is that you can
even do hostile takeovers of other games
communities so by saying that is let's
say for example in acts infinity if we
want to accept generation 0 cats for
example and allow people to like play
with them in our game and then burn them
we're effectively reducing the supply of
cats right and we're also getting the
players into our game who are paying
players who are showing that they are
for example have an interest in crypto
Kitty's right if we actually add value
to their cats or gods Unchained cat form
from my perspective we are increasing
the value of their assets because it can
be used in multiple ecosystems so from
axis perspective we get a lot of
questions asked or can you
add support for our item in in your
ecosystem and we're kind of not doing
that so much yet because it's a pretty
big decision right because these assets
they a lot of our players they spend a
lot of money in the game and if we say
that this is worth something wrong for
example well then that's also probably
going to destroy for that opposing game
right so it's a very hard decision but I
think in general everything that adds in
trouble interoperability usually adds
value if you do it correctly
yeah I was not going to use the word
like cost I'll take over but more like
it was user acquisition strategies that
can be I think
either built in the way that it's still
collaborative and friendly where it's a
win-win for all of the Roper in space or
it can be a bit more aggressive like
just Alex described I think it's also
part of accepting the idea of the
centralization and that the value is no
longer in the end of a central entity
which is a game developer but it's put
in the end of the devil of the users and
users will decide how they appreciate
that value and if they don't like it
they'll start selling it on secondary
marketplaces and if no one want to buy
those items because there's no longer
you did it then yes probably it will
decrease in value but if smart game
developers comes with ID like this and
I've seen it I've seen games that start
using very low priced crypto kitties
that had no specific attributes and turn
them into much more variable content in
their own game and it works pretty well
or like Alex described the fight or you
can burn some of the token to reduce the
scarcity even more and then foods
increase probably the valuation of those
so it's all an open world I wouldn't say
a far west but it's exciting in that
sense so I should I we don't do that in
actually just used to be 100 percent
clear but what we see is that players or
other kind of games they want to use AXI
assets in their games and our response
is always the same if you want to use
axes in your game I mean feel free to
add value to them we're not necessarily
going to condone that we're not going to
say anything about it and unless we
actually approve of what you're doing if
we think that's fine then yeah we're
going to share with our community
because you are providing value for our
players right but if you do it in a bad
way we're just gonna say well okay fine
you do what your thing but you're not
gonna get anything kind of free from us
first thank you for the three great
presentations and personally as a gamer
I was really I'm really interested in
all the blockchain work and the game
business but as mr. got say also pointed
out in his presentation or a panel
discussion about regulatory decisions
from the regulators and as for any game
developers or teams in Korea and this is
also a custom for mr. I think Kim act
actively working in Korea every game
that wants to publish and do business in
Korea has to go through the gaming game
rating committee and get rated as like a
Peggy as in movies and entertainment and
in regulatory wise have you been facing
any regulation regarding blockchain
based gaming business because in Korea
right now the game rating committee
doesn't isn't giving any ratings out
that for games that have anything to do
with blockchain I think just for the
sake of regulating blockchain right
right now so for doing business in Korea
or either at your home country have you
have faced any regulation I like this or
how do you see the regulation will go
out I can answer this one first so I
think recreation first are here not to
be just annoying by nature but seeing on
the long term they are here to protect
the users and generally is a play in
favor of the mass and more specifically
to the sandbox we've incorporated in
Malta and we decided to have a good rip
worthy regular with a regulatory
framework around our token and our NF
T's because playing a long term that
brings more trust ability from the
people and the investor as well and all
the partners in the space the exchange
later on etc because they know we are
regulated so they can trust
that what we are doing we are doing it
in a proper way that we are not claiming
fake numbers whatever and it seems hard
it's I would say to her higher hurdle to
buried add legal costs but the long-term
play is much better and we chose Malta
versus I don't know some time and
Iceland it's era which just by saying
the name you already smile and you you
have this idea of is it's such trustable
business behind so I think it worked for
us maybe to add on that so we're public
in Australia and definitely there are
you know ASIC which is the regulator
there has gone through our documents and
has reviewed it and has blessed it so
there are ways and there are
jurisdictions outside of Malta and
gerbera Alta that will also be ok with
sort of blockchain and tokens the key
distinction being utility versus
security tokens right if there is a
utility and also who was the initial
buyer of the utility then utility token
then that matters as well right because
there's also dual levels one of them is
maybe initially when you sell it to a
sophisticated investor then that's ok
but when you start selling it to the
public or the public is able to buy
those tokens that's when you have
additional concerns as well because
there's buyer protections and SFC rules
related to regular consumers right which
is a distinction so we are okay to sell
even with equity with shares you can
sell shares to sophisticated investor
that's fine but you can't necessarily
there sell the shares to the man on the
street for that you need to be regulated
so it's important to make sure you have
the distinction now there is legal cost
of course and there is seems more
overhead but the way that we think of it
is when you make a game that's on the
blockchain you're making a decision that
this is going to be permanent right
whether it works out or not is a
different story but you're making a
decision that this is a product that
will last forever because it's on the
blockchain so the initial work that
you're doing to make it regulatory and a
press sort of approved is really just a
framework to give it the long term
benefit as far as far as we see
yeah so from axis perspective being very
early adopters in the space we believe
in following best practices and we have
been seen to crypto kitties as leaders
of the space following some of their
leads but what I think is that there's
still too much unclarity like that it's
not clear enough what is best practices
and what isn't so we are trying the best
we can but I would be lying if I said
that everything was 100 percent clear so
that's just the way it is and legal fees
of course are are a concern but I mean
it's as the out said if you're going to
make something that's going to last for
the future things need to be transparent
you need to to be have the integrity and
show people that yes this is the way we
do business and this is the way we do
business long term another questions
so one of the biggest blockchain gaming
promises that allowing users trade trade
their items right away and there are
some criticism around it I believe and
one one is that actually it destroys the
initial like proposed over motive of
gamers and I don't personally believe
that claim but like I think what I heard
is that that's what happened to the
upload tree when they applied
cashy Kesh option to the game user
actually complained a lot because it
destroyed their motive and second
criticism are on the around it is that
so
allowing trading of items it can be
essentially treated as a gambling
especially when when the way user or an
item is controlled by randomness
so what do you guys think about that so
when it comes to the the trading aspect
of it I think everything comes down to
how you actually design the game so
inherently having free trading of items
isn't that bad if you have no utility to
the items because then it's just skins
like dota 2 for example the problem
actually becomes when you have a game
that's being designed from the beginning
where you have a progress based gameplay
so once you get to the end goal that's
kind of it
so if you then allow players to purchase
themselves to the end goal that's a
pretty bad thing and in diablo 3
everything is about beating monsters PvE
type of enemies and so once you get
there the game is done pretty much you
can grind in different levels but if you
have a PvP type of components as well
and then can say that let's say once you
get to the maximum level then this is
where there is fair competition the
players who have the most legendary item
who want to participate in like the skin
game whatever you want to call it where
they want to have really valuable assets
they can purchase up that way but there
needs to be a common ground where there
is warfare and where there is no real
pay to win other than that I also
believe in letting players kind of
purchase their way up because that's
just the way the real world works if
you're making a virtual world it should
echo how the real world is as well and
the fact is that if you work hard in the
real world you can go up and I think
that's very attractive for a lot of
gamers as well and I think that's where
we're going to see a lot of viral growth
once true gamers start realizing that
hey I can actually monetize my time and
still have a significant amount of fun
yeah so I think first when it comes to
marketplaces and trading I think it has
to do with in our view how much value
does a user get out of doing that trade
so when you retro actively put a trading
element into a subscription game as in
Diablo first of all it does feel a
little bit like a money grab right
you're ready getting a monthly fee for
me and now you want me to pay more right
so that's kind of one element of that
now if however
you know that you can make money from
the game itself that might change your
perspective I'll give you a good example
when we first did our deal with HTC to
distribute crypto kitties on their
Exodus phone well and of course the U 12
the earlier generation they wanted to
make sure that the phone came with at
least two kitties so said okay sure
because without two kitties you can't
breed so I said sure we did the math and
we said that'll cost you fifteen US
dollars per phone they're like what
right I have to pay fifteen dollars per
phone and we're shipping like ten
thousand phones that's a lot of money
right you know my margin is like nothing
well you know you have to figure it out
because we couldn't just make the kitty
even though they understood it still be
like wait you can't I can't just give
you a kitty I don't have you know those
you know I don't have those kitties in
reserve I got to go buy them in the
market and then give them to you and we
think is roughly fifteen dollars for a
pair right so that's the point right if
the developer themselves has to dip into
the market place to buy from the
community as well then it's a fair
market place but if I am a developed
like in the case of Diablo it's not fair
at all or World of Warcraft when they
did their auction house cuz you know
what I want to make money
let me just issue a thousand more sorts
that's like the Venezuelan economy
that's just issue some coin and we know
how that turned out
right so in the question on gambling so
when you deal with real money items yes
there is something we do need to look
out especially with loot boxes and
there's laws and right now people are
looking at loot box regulation as well
that's something that's happening
however there is a clear distinction
between sort of environmental gambling
versus peer-to-peer so if I am playing
against you or I'm betting against you
but it's peer-to-peer that that is okay
right so there are ways around it
depending on how you design the game
mechanism and I do think that regulation
will catch up to the point where we have
to be conscious of it but as long as we
are aware of it we can design games
around it like for instance p2p betting
is okay from but you don't want to you
know and you don't want a bookie and you
don't want to all have all these
elements around it
which you maybe can control but at least
you are not the one facilitating it
something I like to add to those two
previous answers is that when will
developing blockchain games we have to
write smart contract and those smart
contracts are public so you can look at
the source code you can we have audit
for the security but we make them
available for everyone to read and
figure out like can we actually cheat
our users and the proof and usually if
that's the case the community will find
out very quickly that that's something
unfair and it's provable thanks to the
blockchain so blockchain adds more
transparency hopefully more trust as
well and if it's not in your game design
and gameplay mechanics that gambling is
inherent to the trading of the items
between the players and I I know I don't
see why would be unfair in that in those
conditions okay hello my name is Damian
and I'm from the item games on Korean
base Korean blockchain game project and
my question is as you did the
presentation yet Co about the content is
talking and the distribution is the
Queen and this is actually our model our
project but my question is that since
you guys are really focused on the
contents itself I'm sure there are some
problems with putting the games on
Google Play Store and the App Store and
when I was looking at your presentation
Alex your your your application was
specifically on the iPhone so how are
you managing to do it are you trying to
put your games on the App Store totally
free but have to access the trading
forum on the different side okay yeah
yeah so first of all I am familiar with
item I actually read the white paper
it's nice for you to be here but when it
comes to the the hole where is the
district where are you going to
distribute your application I think
we're still very early like the the the
the jury is still out on how the
monetization or the how the revenue will
be shared I mean we can do it through
smart contracts quite easily but I think
the biggest problem is that that these
guys are not really ready yet to start
accepting it so for us I mean the
application that we have now on on iOS
is just a test right type of application
where it's very free-to-play you connect
with your email and then you get to see
the amount of access that you have in
your your wallet
which is also the try to email right so
that's one way that we can kind of move
move away from how they are doing it but
I mean I don't have the answer for you
right now I wish I did that would be
great but perhaps perhaps yet or someone
else on the Apple Store and Google Play
Store specific rules so what they will
forbid specifically is not the use of
the cryptocurrency it's more the fact
that you can purchase any digital
content or without using their in-app
purchase libraries so one way to go
around it is to actually use a
centralized login where you can use the
mobile platform to connect to your
account and see the content you've
purchased from another place like a
website what you cannot do from the
mobile app is to prompt the users to buy
the content even once they are logged in
you cannot even try to get them to your
website or marketplace they are not that
stupid and they will not get a 30% cut
there so that's not specifically
inherent to blockchain actually that's
also like how a lot of newspaper
magazine Netflix Spotify etcetera are
doing it so the question you ask is
something that we've been wrangling with
of course and the combination of it was
an experimental experimental app that we
launched I think three or four months
ago called wallet pit you can download
it right now on the App Store globally
we didn't make lots of news around it
because it is blockchain and crypto and
we did however get apples approval to
get it released so it
might possibly be one of the few if not
only officially approved sort of sort of
quasi minigames in that area now to
Seb's point you can't purchase anything
with it and we don't allow you to go
somewhere and take you into an outside
link it does have an embedded wallet and
it has essentially kind of like a sort
of crypto Hampi kind of system it wasn't
it's not great it was simply there to
experiment to see how Apple and Google
would take it so the short answer is it
is possible but you just need to be able
to work with them and in this particular
case we had rigged Stan it's quite a bit
of communication with him as well in
terms of what may or may not work it was
in the review queue for almost four
months so so that's just gives you an
idea but it is a new space where I think
it will become more interesting in the
midterm when blockchain becomes much
more standard is do we expect that the
platform's will want to take a cut on
the transaction revenues generated from
within the app because now they can
measure it as well and if that framework
happens yes they'll take a cut on the
other hand at that point I think it'll
be open to everyone
yeah so I just want to add that I think
if we try to do something specifically
with AXI like you guys did they will
probably get removed pretty fast just
because we have so much volume on our
other marketplace right so at that point
if you start getting noticed I would
assume that I will get worse but I'm not
sure of course as my simply speculation
I don't want to gamble with something
like that quite yet in this particular
case I believe in being a cautious
rather than like very aggressive usually
I am the other way but it's mostly
because some chances you probably won't
if you get banned it's just not a good
thing to get maybe you'll find
decentralized f2 we're getting bastard
well the crypto wallets for me Harv and
the marketplace are those new app stores
for the dubs
so last question sir I'm in there you
came in so you can either sit in a chair
and indeed become global water Otto
okay so if we look change came as
incumbent he looked a makutsi terror so
such an item I had shipped on do so you
know what you get a money crop and also
you know cotton improvement retail so
Joe DiMaggio he oversaw a Cabana k-much

operation on token a DeSoto y Miren
Boudreaux no doc ever grow accumulation
jumped
shortens I think it's something we have
to accommodate with first it's part of
the dynamics of the blockchain as it is
now like so with us no forces we can go
against how the market of blockchain and
how cryptocurrency are evolving that's
also one decision with one of the reason
we decided to have our own
cryptocurrencies and so we can control a
little bit more hopefully the supply the
man and those filtration around it and
try to have I would say a more stable
price point for the users late comers to
the platform once mass adoption is here
right now seeing the usage on some tabs
like ax infinity and crypto kitties it
didn't seem to be such a barrier to the
users to actually buy an F cheese and
increase the trading volume of those
tokens so it's just how much risk and
volatility each individual is able to
take when they are making those decision
to buy the tokens or sell them to trade
I think so I think actually it's a lot
about liquidity in the market so what a
lot of players are scared of is if you
buy something you are unable to sell it
and you watch the value depreciate until
it's almost nothing so I think
volatility is natural in an emerging
space as thin kind of more stabilizes as
things get more normalized we will see
kind of a flatline a little bit but it's
like Bitcoin and any other kind of
cryptocurrency at the beginning since
there are so few people involved and
once more people kind of find the game's
the price will likely go up and then
kind of go down again if it goes the
other way of course so it's a subset
like it's about also managing the
expectations of a user right so if you
promise someone that they're going to
make money playing a game you're doing
it wrong you have to be pretty clear at
the beginning that yes this has some
financial risk it can't potentially go
the other way if you
can actually just create a good game
then people will kind of more likely
hold on to their assets and that also
increases the value of a long term as
well because they have an emotional
connection to it and we actually see
that for a lot of axes or AXI characters
in our game so a lot of the supply is
actually locked up because people they
refuse to sell because they have an
emotional connection to the assets
themselves so if you can kind of get
there then then that's great if you kind
of fail at that then yes it's going to
go to zero so maybe one way to look at
it is when you design a game that is
tokenized on the blockchain you're
running a small country what happens
when there's inflation or what happens
when there's deflation the central bank
steps in they either issue more paper or
they buy so this is a paradigm shift
when you're running a game because in
the past the only way that a game
company would manage the economy is to
make everything more expensive if it was
too much or they just issue more coins
because it costs them nothing in reality
again it's like the Venezuelan economy
because it's all fake but in a
blockchain game is real so if the
volatility is very high and it affects
the economy just like in a country and
suddenly the normal items is no more fun
because it's too expensive or it's bad
because it drops too much then the game
company needs to use its reserves and
step in right if it doesn't do it it is
not serious about blockchain and it is
not serious participant in the joint
economy because it only really cares for
itself right but if it cared for the
players just like a government cares for
its citizens then it will step in and do
something about it now the other thing
is what's beautiful about blockchain is
that participants are also at interest
in saving the economy which means much
like the real government if it's a big
gain economy you can issue game bonds
right and you can raise money from the
community to do deflationary or
inflationary practices that's how we see
in the future now those are items that
do need regulation right which means
that when you
designing a game you need to think about
a game is a real economy and not
actually just for fun all right
that was it for our tonight's session
once again thank you very much for an
old presenter
[Applause]
the company that we're about to bring up
it's called dark
and they're a little bit too technical
ah here dark matter is a global
award-winning FinTech platform for
alternative investments to create
increase actually to increase
transparency and access I don't know if
anyone here has raised funds for an LP
or to manage your own crypto funds but
it's it's a nightmare the paperwork ins
is insanely crazy it's part of the
reason why we haven't raised capital so
these guys are actually changing how GPS
in Opie's work together and find each
other today it's an existing business
they have over ten billion dollars in
assets under management
we met saying in New York we're suppose
things back there so we met saying in
New York and he bought us Korean
barbecue and now we're working together
so please welcome saying leave some
energy up in here started I want to
thank hash for putting this all together
so let's give everybody a round of
applause for hash right now all right
here we go so as Alex mentioned we had
some Korean barbecue in New York I
couldn't find a better choice to buy
them dinner so I just defaulted to what
I knew so we ended up being it was our
second day I think in New York and I
ended up buying them Korean barbecue and
then in Korea they bought me some more
Korean food as well but now we're so
proud and so lucky to be part of the
hash family and we have the opportunity
today to share with you a little bit of
our vision and what we're doing at dark
matter
my name is sang Lee and I'm the
co-founder and CEO of dark matter which
as Alex mentioned is a global effect
platform that's streaming lining the
entire asset management space but before
I get into a lot of details I want to
talk about something that everybody
probably is pretty familiar with so who
remembers this announcement in 2008 the
financial crisis with Lehman collapsed
as bear stearns gets bought out all the
banks get bailed out but not retail
investors or their investments over 20
million jobs were lost in 2008 and about
45
of all global wealth was estimated to be
wiped out within the 18 months following
the Lehman collapse so what was the
actual impact of all of this was it that
banks failed and banks were restructured
sure there was something like that
but in reality it only affected the Main
Street investors because they were
subject to the lack of transparency and
things that they didn't understand on
how banks worked or financial products
worked so I was a part of this in 2008
as an investment banker looking into the
core heart of the problem and basically
realizing that a lot of change needed to
be done and we needed to do it from the
inside out so dark matters right now
it's a leading technology platform
that's connecting investors from all
around the world with different kinds of
asset management products in a
transparent and efficient way asset
management is probably the largest
industry in the world 72 trillion
dollars of assets are actively being
managed right now but there's a problem
because global wealth is anticipated to
grow to 224 trillion dollars which
leaves a hundred fifty trillion dollars
of wealth that's being unmanaged or not
creating wealth for the underlying and
investor and why is that what is the
issue that exists in the industry today
the asset management industry probably
faces some of the worst problems we've
ever seen across the board there's a
massive lack of transparency so I as an
investor when I invest in a product I
pretty much never know what I'm actually
getting into but the funny thing is as
regulators are working to protect
investors it's making things worse for
the investors themselves because the
paperwork is becoming more complicated
and more difficult to understand which
means I actually have no idea what I'm
investing in but regulators and
governments and centralized
organizations keep telling me that I'm
safer and I'm better off but the these
products are even even worse Lee managed
by the fact that you can only buy them
from a conflicted intermediary and
what do I mean by a conflicted
intermediary I have no incentive to
protect you or sell you the best
possible product my incentive is to sell
you the thing that makes the most money
for me in the United States we call them
the deal well laws there's so many laws
that are changing because people are
getting ripped off in their retirement
funds because advisors were putting in
products that were not appropriate for
them and they didn't understand what
these products were and they end up
getting wiped out they end up not being
able to pay for their kids colleges but
at the same time because of all these
regulations and more protections and
more centralized organizations and more
intermediaries that regulators are
saying are good for the system the costs
are increasing over time and when the
costs increase over time what do I do as
the asset manager or the person that's
supposed to be working with you to make
your situation better I stop selling to
you I stop selling it to you because
you're a Main Street investor and that's
just a headache it's costing me more
money so what do I do I keep going back
to the sophisticated institutional's the
centralized organizations where I can
get a ten million dollar check for the
same cost as getting a ten thousand
dollar check even in the logical sense
of the word you would never do business
like that because it's too expensive so
how are we fixing it today we've already
created a platform for three and a half
years to create a direct connection
capability between the investor and the
asset manager while streamlining the
compliance and the workflow so that the
fund manager themselves also has a
better time and is able to access these
investors in a very efficient way and
we're the first ones to do cross-border
investments what is a FinTech platform
if it doesn't provide investors all
around the world with the same level of
access as you can from Wall Street and
we've penetrated globally with just four
offices located in New York Ukraine
Shanghai and Seoul we've penetrated over
26 countries so investors from over 26
country
can access different investment
opportunities that they never would have
seen before and we're working with some
of the top funds 150-plus globally and
hopefully we can have hashed on there as
well when they do realize that the fund
is going to be in fruition and we're
continuing to work with these
organizations to show them that the
decentralized and the non intermediated
effect is actually better for everybody
in the long run and we used to think
that this was a Wall Street problem when
I first started that this was a u.s.
problem because US investors were very
sophisticated they've been investing in
these things for over 60 70 years so we
went all around the world and asked the
question
hey is this a problem that needs to be
solved and globally they told us both
from the technology front as well as
from the traditional financial services
front this is something that needed to
be changed we've actually never had a
client say no when they're using our
platform because the underlying need for
change is so imperative and so expensive
and so conflicted that everybody knows
that the change is coming it's just a
matter of when and how and we you know
the cryptocurrency world tends to
conflict itself with Wall Street but in
reality we have a little bit of a
different stance we need to bring them
into the community they have to be
participants in the ecosystem so that
they can protect the integrity and align
their own interests when they're working
with people all around the world so we
have advisors asset management companies
banks they need to cater and abate
better way and they realize that they
too will become disintermediated as a
part of this change so while we've run
this platform for three and a half years
we realize that the next step of
efficiency and access comes from true
decentralization it's not enough to be
disintermediated it has to align the
interests of everybody that's
participating in the system so that the
access to the investors
and the protections that are provided to
the investors are not brought about by
centralized governments or regulatory
arms or third-party administrators we
have to provide the protections to
ourselves the investors are able to
protect themselves and the asset
managers or the traditional firms can no
longer take advantage of this situation
because they have to be directly aligned
to the structural integrity of the
ecosystem where they'll get wiped out as
well what's happening when we implement
a blockchain into what we're doing today
with the global ecosystem that will be
the foundational component of our
blockchain project there's no more need
for paperwork right now we've done a
pretty good job of disintermediating but
the paperwork itself doesn't change I
don't know if anyone has seen fun
prospectus Azure if you have a 401k or
retirement fund it could be up to 300
pages I've never read one in my entire
life and the thing about that is that
actually creates massive conflicts of
interest to actually push complicated
things to investors in a smart contract
the actual interactions themselves are
not brought about by people but about
with the technology and the hashes
everybody knows here like I've mentioned
just previously the blockchain system
allows us to align the interests of
those that are creating the wealth and
those that are consuming the wealth and
what do I mean by that really there's a
massive moral hazard issue in financial
services when I invest with you I have
no incentive to do good by you because
I'm making money regardless but in this
system with skin in the game you
actually have to contribute and pay into
the system to protect the compliance and
the smart contracts that are the
underlying component of all wealth
management that we see in the future and
thirdly we can remove fraud and error
Madoff is physically impossible in the
blockchain that means every single
person that invested in Madoff had to
lie to each other and then lie to the
news at
same time that's physically impossible
to create a Ponzi scheme using a
blockchain consensus system an error
there's massive amounts of error that
are happening even at the biggest banks
and what do they do they just pay the 75
million in fines to the SEC and FINRA
that's the easiest way for it business
as usual we can avoid all of that with
the blockchain upgrade and what we're
really excited about is democratizing
access for all wealth management and
wealth creation products across the
board like I mentioned previously
there's no incentive if it's not
efficient for me to talk to a smaller
investor versus a larger investor why
would I ever do that when it's costing
me the same amount of time and money but
if I can provide that efficiency and the
transparency for that access we can
bring in the wealth creation
capabilities that Wall Street had and
spread it across the entire world into
every kind of region through technology
and not through large banks so what are
we doing right now the DM coin is going
to provide that utility to transparency
and that access so that investors all
around the world will have equal level
of transparency and protection and even
better access than we see right now
without the need for intermediaries
without the need for third parties and
potentially even without the need for
complicated government regulations
that's the future of wealth management
where any investor in the world has the
same level of access and protection that
they would have or even better than what
we have right now and the team is
actually pretty uniquely situated for a
blockchain situation and what do I mean
by that we come from very diverse
professional backgrounds from the top
organizations in the world working in
communication innovation investment
banking and technology but we're
probably also the most culturally
diverse blockchain team in the
world and what does that really mean for
us as a company it means that we bring
diverse backgrounds in understanding how
a global community can really integrate
understanding the underlying cultural
nuances of different places and bringing
that to bear through a globalized
decentralized wealth distribution and
creation system if you have any
questions we'll be around for the rest
of the day or feel free to shoot us a
note thank you very much
[Applause]
[Music]
Wow
[Music]
[Music]
objective today is to kind of discuss
let each other carbons are very readily
seen blockchain information nowadays we
met a lot of petitions in Korea and
their real mind
[Music]
[Music]
[Music]
what you see out that the current
Sparkle had pretty much geocentric this
presents a huge opportunity for our
market architecture
so we hydro X X square has started to
build and develop already you know in
the market right now is to be layer 2 we
did it dynamic
[Music]
you
hello yeah so uh thank you for accepting
your interview we're very honored to
have you our hash - yeah so to the
audience's who are not well aware of any
mock up range could you briefly explain
about you and your mocha brand sure
honey mocha brands is a public game
company in the city in Australia we have
a traditional mobile game business but
we're now very heavily investing in
blockchain gaming and in 2018 we've done
a lot of moves in that space hmm how
about yourself because you explained
about you're introducing all yourself
sure so I have been in sort of both
internet and gaming business for over
three decades you know I think sort of
my very first actually my very first job
was acting with Atari in the 80s and I
kind of half joke about this because I
started really working and coding for
them when I was maybe 12 or 13 years old
and it's funny because of course that's
kind of child labor it's probably not
entirely legal but back then you
couldn't find programmers and I think
the area's kind of similar to today as
well which is you know if you are very
good at coding or if you're very good at
the same blockchain for instance age
doesn't matter and you can always find a
job because guess it's could you explain
the current court business about omocha
brands now well the core business is a
mobile games business which generates
the majority of the historical revenues
in sort of tower defense games based on
a filament but recently we especially in
this quarter in this last quarter we've
done a lot of activities in blockchain
including obviously our recent deal on
sandbox as well as in launch our formula
one sort of NFC option so all of the
activities that we've been investing in
a blockchain basically have started to
bear fruit in the first quarter of 29
and you know we certainly hope that the
blockchain side of the business will
become bigger in the new term hmm so as
you mentioned about the blockchain
recently we've heard much news that any
maka brains invested in several
blockchain game companies so what makes
you trigger to have interest in
blockchain games so or what is so
special about blockchain and gaming so
many before I talk about auction and
gaming talk briefly about sort of
blockchain exactly why is blockchain so
important right so obviously you know
with the internet we've been given sort
of access and information but one of the
challenges that we now have is there's a
breakdown in trust and there's a
breakdown actually there is no value and
really if you think about it right so
what blockchain delivers at scale really
is a form of what actually is is a trust
framework or he can basically transact
this way but one of the challenges of
blockchain has is it optional that's all
if you don't get people using it it can
never actually really come to fruition
and I look at the similar parallels back
to 96 97 you know back then when you
know AOL and and sort of it's on a soft
Bank and Yahoo and oh you know Amazon
all these companies when they emerged
there were only 36 million Internet
users and back then we were always
trying to sort of you know I was a big
believer and I was like how do we get
more people to use the internet you know
dial-up internet is hard then you have
to understand tcp/ip after standard DNS
right but we all saw what the internet
could be when I saw the potential but we
also knew it was difficult because once
you got a person to go online they went
to a pretty crappy website and they said
that's not very interesting why should I
do this right so it was in bocce is kind
of the same thing but there was one
industry that pushed board that
connectivity in a way and that was
gaining so gaming really delivered a
larger form of mass adoption for
Internet as well you know people were
first playing multi-user dungeons and
they were playing sort of online
every war Fiji's network connections in
in large part they became big users of
the internet so we did blockchain the
same and we think has an added advantage
gamers understand virtual value I don't
have to explain to them why do you have
to spend money for digital codes why do
you have to spend money on digital
weapons they get it so we think that's a
that's not too crazy Aleppo so that's
one advantage and therefore we can
create more adoption faster so that's
the first reason
we don't watch any gaming is important
but the second reason we think it's so
important is that our industry is
actually slowing down right there's 2.3
billion gamers and while there's it's a
growing market it is not cooling 30 40
50 percent it's growing
you know six percent or maybe eight
percent and so what is a new paradigm
that can shift them and we believe
blockchain basically will create a new
wave of conversion and growth because of
to digitalization would you give us some
examples of the companies giving the
steady so why did you make a decision of
those companies and what do they want to
achieve on top of property well I mean
one of our favorite projects that he
might know is sandbox and so sandbox is
basically in a nutshell kind of like a
Minecraft on about you and we love that
a lot because minecraft actually was an
early form of decentralized gaming it
was decentralized because everyone could
host their own servers and basically run
their own worlds and it wasn't really
owned by anyone at that moment in time
but the challenge that minecraft had is
that while it provided information and
access it could not transfer value as
way if I was playing a Minecraft game on
server one I couldn't actually transfer
that value into minecraft server - which
meant that there was no consistent
transfer and everyone ultimately had to
ask people to play their particular
sermon
so with sandbox what we like about this
is that you actually through the
blockchain Mint non-tangible tokens
which can then be transferred as
permanent items throughout any one of
the other sort of sandbox games that
play like Minecraft and what we love
about that as well is that they are all
designed in boxes so voxels obviously
like digital Legos and thing about
digital Legos is anyone can do it right
you know you don't need to know
Photoshop you know 3d max you can make
beautiful items I give someone bunch of
labels they can make something that
means everyone can be a creator that
means everyone can become a sort of
someone who can make so that's one set
where we think user-generated entities
are going to be one kind of revolution a
little bit like the maker movement are
sort of Etsy the other area that we're
very focused on our projects related to
brand identities so recently for me the
one also are sort of acquisition of
striking which does football brands like
the Bundesliga and Bayern Munich
these are deals that are important for
us because we think the first wave of
mass adoption will happen with brands
that non blockchain people are familiar
with right today this may be 30 million
blockchain users it's not very big all
right that's nothing it's not big so we
can focus on the 30 million and that's
one thing but there's a few billion
people who we still need to move and so
how do we bring the extra billion into
it we think if there's a brand that you
know let's say at Formula One only one
has 1.4 billion viewers half a billion
fans right even if a small percentage
says you know what I'm gonna try this
game and play around with non fungible
tokens and learn about blockchain that's
a huge win because even if we can just
get a few million people a big number in
the blockchain as I think branded IP in
the short term become very
especially for collectibles and of
course the most famous one that's in a
portfolio is crypto keys that relax and
you know that's how it all kind of began
with us as well so when it comes to
blocks and gaming none fungible token is
now being a global trend
so would you briefly explain what nft is
and why blockchain gaming companies are
focusing on NFT well first of all I
would say that not enough companies are
focusing manatees however I would say
you know to explain sort of in fast
terms more than any seers know much like
the blockchain can confirm sort of the
provenance and validity of the fact that
this is a true that's a Bitcoin or
either and you don't have to worry about
it being forged with a non-refundable
token you can do the same for individual
items in device ball they are scarce
they are unique whether you make one ten
or hundred it's confirmed and that in
itself adds a huge element of trust now
I know that if this was a digital
company I know that there's only one of
them so is it worth $1 $10 I don't know
but I know there's only one right so
that's one aspect that you couldn't do
before because before I can give you a
digital cup and you can make a thousand
copies in fact in games they make a
million copies so the cup has no value
and I don't care about it but in the
real world actually a cup does have
value in its utility in assumption now
what an honorable token can do on top
that is exciting beyond the fact that
it's scarce is that it has provenance in
history that is certified immediately if
I buy a Picasso I have to go to the
museum or go to a curator I have to go
to an art collector you have to certify
is to give me a document the painting
without the document and the certificate
is not worth that much
because I don't know if it's true it
could be fake only with the certificate
is it valuable
blockchain is Auto certificate every
time I do something digital I get a
certificate so you can do it on mass now
take that concept one step further this
is a normal cup but if I sell it to you
maybe it's one dollar because it's a
normal cup user to drink but if Mick
Jagger owned this company is it worth
$100 or is it worth $1,000 mmm maybe
it's worth $10,000
so who hold it or who made it matters
just like art the other thing that's of
course fascinating especially in the
gaming world is when you think about
weapons or items you know the sword that
won the championship or the gun that got
to level 50 even though it's exactly the
same gun that gun that won the
championship is worth more and becomes a
collector item it's the same thing when
you play tennis you can buy the same
tennis racquet in the store for hundred
bucks
but if Roger Federer won the tournament
would that racket it's worth more than
hundred so these are all things you can
now do in the digital world at mass
scale very interesting concept and the
next question is many people in the
blockchain gaming industry expect that
blockchain gaming will be their new
opportunity but conservatively there are
only several hundred thousands users in
blockchain machine and revenue boxing
game companies are not big enough yet so
in this circumstance why are you so
bullish on blockchain gaming market in
2008 in 2009 we started going into
mobile gaming when we first saw the
first smartphone and we saw that the App
Store was about
with that we said this could be
something big but of course at that time
we weren't sure I would say blockchain
gaming this is same how many big
companies were doing mobile games in
2009-2010 zero and those companies that
did mobile games became the leaders of
today whether its supercell Romeo you
know these are or even you know
companies that move to mobile go Mike go
home whatever these are companies that
were not doing well and have done
incredibly well because they went with a
growing emerging trend and we think
locked in to say so I think to look at
one chain to say this is the Morocco
today is not correct I think you have to
look at what do you think blockchain
will be in the future
now we believe that it's in the early
adopter phase so we think that sort of
blockchain gaming is two or three years
away from rapid mass adoption that's
what we believe it might be wrong right
but but if we are right then we can move
with that massive trend off and we think
many indicators show that it is you know
one of the important theories when you
talk about the diffusion of innovation
curve is essentially social diffusion
how many people know about it and they
may not know everything about it but
they have heard of it or they might care
about them and with blockchain it's just
like Internet you know like 25 years ago
or even Mobile Smartphone 2000 sort of
19 2010 you may not have owned a
smartphone but somewhere in your network
someone is telling you that Apple iPhone
that's the best thing right I have it it
costs a lot of money and it's really
good and I don't have one yet
so I hear about it thinking about it but
I'm not sure and blockchain is like that
too you know I may not have Bitcoin I
may not understand it but somewhere in
my social network some crazy guy was
telling me blockchain is going to change
the world it's gonna do it that it's
gonna be a revolution and you have to do
it it's kind of the same period so
whether we are 12 months off or
something I don't know but I definitely
personally believe that
and discuss where the adoption will move
rapidly so you've mentioned about
massive reduction so what do you think
are the key factor is to grow the
blockchain game market number one is
usability mmm us I mean anyone who is
trying to set up madam asked can
understand exactly how difficult it is
and to me madam asked is the parallel to
dial up internet 96-97
for those of you who remember how it was
like to connect all to the Internet you
had to buy a modem you had to have a
router you had to understand tcp/ip and
you had to set up your DNS but these are
all things but not everyone will do
right so you had to ask a friend
hey can he help me get to the Internet
and then they'll help you get on the
internet and then you go online and so
adoptions slow because it's just
difficult and then on top of it when
you're online actually it's a pretty
crappy website so it doesn't look that
great right now
lock-in is the same actually at the
moment Clank if I have to set up many
masks
you probably lose everyone within the
first I think one minute all right and
then there's another five minutes just
to get it right okay and then maybe ten
minutes if you don't really know what
you're doing but so that usability of
the wallet and the adoption on the
blockchain needs to be solved and I
that's why I think a gaming is very good
because some of the concepts that we're
trying to teach around trust and sort of
awareness of blockchain needs to be
educated but the problem is you have to
go through these steps so how can you go
through these steps without making it
feel boring or make it feel difficult
and so gamification I think also plays a
role you can make the process fun and
educational how many children learn
educational topics because it's game a
fun time so we think it's the same thing
and I think as that was result gaming
will be a key factor in bridging
blockchain adoption
and when I met clapping game founders
most of them are struggling with the
current infrastructure of the blockchain
technology so what obstacles should
blockchain game developers overcome to
make a success in the industry so I
actually think the technology is not the
most limiting factor because you can
separate the value aspect and maybe put
that on the public chain even if it's
slow like ethereal it would still have
the value aspect when you're transacting
with money or something that has sort of
value it can take some time when you're
playing the game it doesn't always have
to be on chain right unless there is an
aspect what value is exchanged right
maybe when you're doing a bet or
something or when you're fighting for
something that is real but where a
strong level of trust is not needed but
if it's for fun and if it's for
entertainment then you don't need it to
be on the public chain nobody said that
you replace every database in the world
right in fact a normal my sequel
database can do the job just fine for
most of the gameplay aspects so I think
that's a technical distinction we need
to make what I think is a bigger
challenge is making a blockchain game
that has the elements of fun but our
also value based so one of the
challenges that games have is that many
game designers talk about economies but
it's not an economy right it's unless
you call Venezuela an economy right
which is of course is not really proper
an economy it's an entirely inflationary
it has no real sustainable value and it
tends to live very short so game
developers don't have to worry about a
game that lives forever right I mean the
crew makes a game and says this game
will last a thousand years
right that's not what you think my
people think of a game one year two
years three years or five years so if
you think of it that way then of course
you have no permanent economy
you don't to think about it that way so
to me that is the most essential
thinking that a game designer has to
become an economist a real one and has
to think about consequences that are
long-term and how does he manage that
which is super difficult so I think the
planning that goes in and the UX that
goes into a game has to change and that
to me is the challenge because even if
you know how to make a fun game that
doesn't mean you really understand
values and if you know how to understand
value because your big blockchain geek
doesn't mean that you understand how to
make a fun game so that bridging it
still has to happen to to traditional
game developers who are Nadia jumped in
to the blockchain game industry what
would you want to advise them well I
mean there's a lot of things right but
obviously I think the first thing I
would suggest for them is anything you
know focus on what is the most value to
your customer often not just game
companies every company when you have a
mature industry we sometimes forget
what's important for our customer and we
think more about our product but who
does a product serve it serves the
customer so what is best for the
customer so once we start thinking about
what is best for the customer at that
point we can probably design the right
framework for a long-lasting game and so
for the game developers I ask the
question is the way you're making games
today really the best experience for
your customer and I'm pretty sure most
of them don't think that way they think
of an existing model they have a lot of
science they have a lot of data they
think about how to make a lot of money
from their customers right but is it
really the best experience for the
customer
so you know when you think of the
history of games in the beginning we had
packaged games right you know
$40 $50 I buy a CD and pop it in I play
on PlayStation Xbox right and the
conversion the number of people playing
games was ready to be smaller and most
people still didn't buy games because
people didn't understand the value why
would I pay $50 for something I don't
know right so so then they had demos I
like versions so you try the lite
version so more people convert so I can
try it out a little bit more value but I
still have to pay for the full game
before I played and then the big
revolution was essentially freemium
games right you can play the entire game
for free now why was that attractive and
why did it kill most of the paid game
industry in terms of especially mobile
because it was more value to the user it
was a better experience for the customer
of course a customer if he has a choice
to play for free will choose to play for
free and to pay money so that value came
in but then they you know it started
finding ways to make more and more money
which is I guess needed as a business
but now I people have lost trust in the
games because you're taking so much
value from me but then you're not giving
any back to me so the conversion rates
suffer so I think the next paradigm of
blockchain is games of value if I
actually am playing a game and I have
value maybe I can even earn money or at
least have sort of long-term retention
or I can take the item and give it to my
children even if the game shuts down
I can still own the items then the
investment in the game is no longer lost
and as a result we think that conversion
has more value and more value means more
adoption
this has been my last question so if you
have anything to say or hashed audiences
who are watching this or the curve of
gamers would you share something to them
well I mean for all of you crypto gamers
you are early adopters and innovators so
you're definitely driving forward a
driving forward a and industry so you
know we're certainly honored and pleased
to be part of this one thing I will say
and we see this with early forms of
gamers as well it's a it's a territory
that you own but in order to allow a
broader market to enter you need to
welcome them and I think if that I have
one thing that I would love for the
community to become better at is to
welcome people who know nothing because
that's what we need and nobody you know
you are the experts so you know
everything about it to make the market
bigger you have to become teachers so
those who don't okay well thank you very
much for your time and valuable pinions
thank you very much thank you
the company that we're about to bring up
it's called dark
and they're a little bit too technical
ah here dark matter is a global
award-winning FinTech platform for
alternative investments to create
increase actually to increase
transparency and access I don't know if
anyone here has raised funds for an LP
or to manage your own crypto funds but
it's it's a nightmare the paperwork ins
is insanely crazy it's part of the
reason why we haven't raised capital so
these guys are actually changing how GPS
in Opie's work together and find each
other today it's an existing business
they have over ten billion dollars in
assets under management
we met saying in New York we're suppose
things back there so we met saying in
New York and he bought us Korean
barbecue and now we're working together
so please welcome saying leave some
energy up in here started I want to
thank hash for putting this all together
so let's give everybody a round of
applause for hash right now all right
here we go so as Alex mentioned we had
some Korean barbecue in New York I
couldn't find a better choice to buy
them dinner so I just defaulted to what
I knew so we ended up being it was our
second day I think in New York and I
ended up buying them Korean barbecue and
then in Korea they bought me some more
Korean food as well but now we're so
proud and so lucky to be part of the
hash family and we have the opportunity
today to share with you a little bit of
our vision and what we're doing at dark
matter
my name is sang Lee and I'm the
co-founder and CEO of dark matter which
as Alex mentioned is a global effect
platform that's streaming lining the
entire asset management space but before
I get into a lot of details I want to
talk about something that everybody
probably is pretty familiar with so who
remembers this announcement in 2008 the
financial crisis with Lehman collapsed
as bear stearns gets bought out all the
banks get bailed out but not retail
investors or their investments over 20
million jobs were lost in 2008 and about
45
of all global wealth was estimated to be
wiped out within the 18 months following
the Lehman collapse so what was the
actual impact of all of this was it that
banks failed and banks were restructured
sure there was something like that
but in reality it only affected the Main
Street investors because they were
subject to the lack of transparency and
things that they didn't understand on
how banks worked or financial products
worked so I was a part of this in 2008
as an investment banker looking into the
core heart of the problem and basically
realizing that a lot of change needed to
be done and we needed to do it from the
inside out so dark matters right now
it's a leading technology platform
that's connecting investors from all
around the world with different kinds of
asset management products in a
transparent and efficient way asset
management is probably the largest
industry in the world 72 trillion
dollars of assets are actively being
managed right now but there's a problem
because global wealth is anticipated to
grow to 224 trillion dollars which
leaves a hundred fifty trillion dollars
of wealth that's being unmanaged or not
creating wealth for the underlying and
investor and why is that what is the
issue that exists in the industry today
the asset management industry probably
faces some of the worst problems we've
ever seen across the board there's a
massive lack of transparency so I as an
investor when I invest in a product I
pretty much never know what I'm actually
getting into but the funny thing is as
regulators are working to protect
investors it's making things worse for
the investors themselves because the
paperwork is becoming more complicated
and more difficult to understand which
means I actually have no idea what I'm
investing in but regulators and
governments and centralized
organizations keep telling me that I'm
safer and I'm better off but the these
products are even even worse Lee managed
by the fact that you can only buy them
from a conflicted intermediary and
what do I mean by a conflicted
intermediary I have no incentive to
protect you or sell you the best
possible product my incentive is to sell
you the thing that makes the most money
for me in the United States we call them
the deal well laws there's so many laws
that are changing because people are
getting ripped off in their retirement
funds because advisors were putting in
products that were not appropriate for
them and they didn't understand what
these products were and they end up
getting wiped out they end up not being
able to pay for their kids colleges but
at the same time because of all these
regulations and more protections and
more centralized organizations and more
intermediaries that regulators are
saying are good for the system the costs
are increasing over time and when the
costs increase over time what do I do as
the asset manager or the person that's
supposed to be working with you to make
your situation better I stop selling to
you I stop selling it to you because
you're a Main Street investor and that's
just a headache it's costing me more
money so what do I do I keep going back
to the sophisticated institutional's the
centralized organizations where I can
get a ten million dollar check for the
same cost as getting a ten thousand
dollar check even in the logical sense
of the word you would never do business
like that because it's too expensive so
how are we fixing it today we've already
created a platform for three and a half
years to create a direct connection
capability between the investor and the
asset manager while streamlining the
compliance and the workflow so that the
fund manager themselves also has a
better time and is able to access these
investors in a very efficient way and
we're the first ones to do cross-border
investments what is a FinTech platform
if it doesn't provide investors all
around the world with the same level of
access as you can from Wall Street and
we've penetrated globally with just four
offices located in New York Ukraine
Shanghai and Seoul we've penetrated over
26 countries so investors from over 26
country
can access different investment
opportunities that they never would have
seen before and we're working with some
of the top funds 150-plus globally and
hopefully we can have hashed on there as
well when they do realize that the fund
is going to be in fruition and we're
continuing to work with these
organizations to show them that the
decentralized and the non intermediated
effect is actually better for everybody
in the long run and we used to think
that this was a Wall Street problem when
I first started that this was a u.s.
problem because US investors were very
sophisticated they've been investing in
these things for over 60 70 years so we
went all around the world and asked the
question
hey is this a problem that needs to be
solved and globally they told us both
from the technology front as well as
from the traditional financial services
front this is something that needed to
be changed we've actually never had a
client say no when they're using our
platform because the underlying need for
change is so imperative and so expensive
and so conflicted that everybody knows
that the change is coming it's just a
matter of when and how and we you know
the cryptocurrency world tends to
conflict itself with Wall Street but in
reality we have a little bit of a
different stance we need to bring them
into the community they have to be
participants in the ecosystem so that
they can protect the integrity and align
their own interests when they're working
with people all around the world so we
have advisors asset management companies
banks they need to cater and abate
better way and they realize that they
too will become disintermediated as a
part of this change so while we've run
this platform for three and a half years
we realize that the next step of
efficiency and access comes from true
decentralization it's not enough to be
disintermediated it has to align the
interests of everybody that's
participating in the system so that the
access to the investors
and the protections that are provided to
the investors are not brought about by
centralized governments or regulatory
arms or third-party administrators we
have to provide the protections to
ourselves the investors are able to
protect themselves and the asset
managers or the traditional firms can no
longer take advantage of this situation
because they have to be directly aligned
to the structural integrity of the
ecosystem where they'll get wiped out as
well what's happening when we implement
a blockchain into what we're doing today
with the global ecosystem that will be
the foundational component of our
blockchain project there's no more need
for paperwork right now we've done a
pretty good job of disintermediating but
the paperwork itself doesn't change I
don't know if anyone has seen fun
prospectus Azure if you have a 401k or
retirement fund it could be up to 300
pages I've never read one in my entire
life and the thing about that is that
actually creates massive conflicts of
interest to actually push complicated
things to investors in a smart contract
the actual interactions themselves are
not brought about by people but about
with the technology and the hashes
everybody knows here like I've mentioned
just previously the blockchain system
allows us to align the interests of
those that are creating the wealth and
those that are consuming the wealth and
what do I mean by that really there's a
massive moral hazard issue in financial
services when I invest with you I have
no incentive to do good by you because
I'm making money regardless but in this
system with skin in the game you
actually have to contribute and pay into
the system to protect the compliance and
the smart contracts that are the
underlying component of all wealth
management that we see in the future and
thirdly we can remove fraud and error
Madoff is physically impossible in the
blockchain that means every single
person that invested in Madoff had to
lie to each other and then lie to the
news at
same time that's physically impossible
to create a Ponzi scheme using a
blockchain consensus system an error
there's massive amounts of error that
are happening even at the biggest banks
and what do they do they just pay the 75
million in fines to the SEC and FINRA
that's the easiest way for it business
as usual we can avoid all of that with
the blockchain upgrade and what we're
really excited about is democratizing
access for all wealth management and
wealth creation products across the
board like I mentioned previously
there's no incentive if it's not
efficient for me to talk to a smaller
investor versus a larger investor why
would I ever do that when it's costing
me the same amount of time and money but
if I can provide that efficiency and the
transparency for that access we can
bring in the wealth creation
capabilities that Wall Street had and
spread it across the entire world into
every kind of region through technology
and not through large banks so what are
we doing right now the DM coin is going
to provide that utility to transparency
and that access so that investors all
around the world will have equal level
of transparency and protection and even
better access than we see right now
without the need for intermediaries
without the need for third parties and
potentially even without the need for
complicated government regulations
that's the future of wealth management
where any investor in the world has the
same level of access and protection that
they would have or even better than what
we have right now and the team is
actually pretty uniquely situated for a
blockchain situation and what do I mean
by that we come from very diverse
professional backgrounds from the top
organizations in the world working in
communication innovation investment
banking and technology but we're
probably also the most culturally
diverse blockchain team in the
world and what does that really mean for
us as a company it means that we bring
diverse backgrounds in understanding how
a global community can really integrate
understanding the underlying cultural
nuances of different places and bringing
that to bear through a globalized
decentralized wealth distribution and
creation system if you have any
questions we'll be around for the rest
of the day or feel free to shoot us a
note thank you very much
[Applause]
[Music]
Wow
all right so the next project Oh is in
the beauty industry oh yeah
with over two million monthly active
users they closed out the 2017 fiscal
year with forty four million dollars in
revenue so who is or in many ways was
responsible for bringing a beauty to the
Chinese audience I want you to please
welcome home on song founder and CEO of
voice how most amoeba thank
everyone yeah I'm here to talk about
Beauty there's no question that beauty
is growing and it is one of the most
profitable industry in globally in
global scape China Korea states I think
the reason the reason for it is high
probability is that because this is
mainly ladies business it's not hard it
is not easy to deal with ladies I'm
quite sure about that however in this
beauty market there are some problems
the reason is there are so many fake
data there are so many dishonest
contents that distracts participants for
individual customers and companies in
the customer side there are billions of
ladies and gentlemens creates Beauty
contents
however like 1% 0.1% limited people get
incentive for generating those contents
even though they are contributing this
platform second there are so many
dishonest data and sponsored experience
that distracts a actual experience of
customers so customers get confused
in the company side yes I sell cosmetics
however it is not easy to actually break
down into the very deep stream and find
out what what was our marketing
efficiency were they do a lot of brand
marketing they do product marketing in
different channels and combined they
don't know which is much more efficient
secondly cosmetic companies are
currently having hard times to acquire
data is very essential data to make a
very good profits to make a very good
products
the reason is data there has no like
one-dimensional or two-dimensional sets
of data that can actually give insights
to the companies that make products and
thirdly it's also really hard to make a
target approach to the customers
Facebook Instagram they do provide a
rate good advertisement product however
we don't think that's enough and we
don't think that's the end of this
beauty sector so what we are trying to
do in this cosmic chain is in our
platform we are going to redistribute
the ownership and the management
authority of the beauty related datas
and beauty related contents by rewarding
participants at the level of very keen
and systematic incentive system
so it's pretty much simple step one
mainly ladies users comes into our
platform cause my chain platform and
they enjoy it they watch video they buy
products they can also participate in
surveys and it's it's going to much much
funner and it's going through much more
excitement and it's going to be a place
where ladies can actually learn about
how to use the product when to use
certain products where to buy it
so users participate in this platform
just for fun obviously they do get
rewards by participation it's going to
be in a very systematic way for the D
word in this process
nextly we costume change is going to
collect all those kind of datas number
one it's going to be very basic profiles
skin types skin problems nationality
male/female age it's going to be a very
key assets that can provide very
fundamental data's for companies
secondly it's going to be about what
kind of Beauty contents that certain or
specific customer actually consumes or
like or write the comments on third is
going to be about the purchase data or
usage data certain title products which
brands when they buy it how often all
these main three data sets will be going
to be collected and discussed much in
platform these data sets will be used by
and is going to be paid by certain
businesses that are going to be also
participants of this cost machine
platform for the businesses who makes
products so
when they need ideation they can do a
open survey if they need us some
feedback from customers they can open
also a feedback chat rooms and also for
the marketing's brand companies it's
going to be much more sophisticated
advertisement platform for sales
marketplace tens thousands of brand
company will be loved to join this Cosmo
chain platform let me show you some
examples here the first years case it's
a list of the company in Korea just
about 22 it's mainly makeup companies so
I don't use tools on 22 however when
they want to come up with new let's say
a lipstick what kind of colors what kind
of okay it's literally mixed up yeah
we'll go this one so if if it's it's
pretty much simple so let's say a
company wants to make up a new lipstick
a new product every sets of collective
data can be achieved in this platform
and all the individual participants who
are willingly going to provide the data
will be gain gain a reward for this can
you move back once more sure yeah and
also when it comes to marketing we are
going to be able to provide at which
stage the customer actually saw the
advertisement on the base of the content
also what kind of product and what kind
of product information that individuals
were locked in so we are able to provide
much more accurate and we are able to
provide much more efficient marketing
platforms for the
other topic is about marketplace
obviously there are strong needs for the
companies to actually sell the products
to the customers and it's all about
targeting it's all about targeting
segmentation and because we have much
more sophisticated data about the
purchase contents consumption and the
rate based profiles we will be able to
provide much more efficient ways to
actually sell the products to the
customers in order to make all these
examples happening happen we provide so
this is our token model so basically we
have coin it's going to be every word
it's going to be a token and also it's
called cosmic coin and within the
platform we are going to reward our
participants by cosmic power power coin
is obviously going to be convertible and
also there is going to be a one more
index called customer level which means
that cosmic power can be used in the
marketplace and it's going to be can be
converted to the coin however level is
going to be the like net acquisition
about the custom power which stands for
the total contribution level for each
participants and in order to make our
platform much much expand faster and
larger we are at this stage inviting a
lot of partnerships such as Beauty
contents platforms and brand companies
advertisement companies and para
research companies
or in the global scale our main focus is
going to be China
States and Korea our strategy is pretty
much straightforward we are going to
make a platform we are going to have a
lot of partnerships in in every values
in every relevant aspect and combining
all those customer data and reward that
rewarding our individual participants
with our coins we believe that we can
actually achieve a much more
sophisticated
in this beauty sector
um there's a lot of people people on the
back there's a lot of seats on this side
so feel free to migrate that way I don't
think people dare bite so we got one
last pitch for you guys and then and
then Dom will come in step up and say
hello we've all heard about problems in
the ad tech industry if you've worked an
ad tech like gnew or Ethan has you've
definitely heard of a company called
kochava they are the leaders in mobile
attribution and analytics there are our
most recent investment and we're
actually super confident that if anybody
solves ad tech and blockchain
it's probably Charles and his team
actually Charles flew out to have lunch
with us and then flew back home and then
actually flew in this morning
so please welcome Charles Manning from
exchange thank you sir
I'm I must be on a second wind because I
am not sleepy at all I was about an hour
and a half ago but I am I'm good for the
night I'm so grateful to be invited to
come out and share what we're doing with
kochava and in particular what we're
doing with exchange there is a tectonic
shift that's happening right now in
advertising and that shift has largely
benefited Google and Facebook but
there's an opportunity where the rest of
the market can actually get unified
under a common protocol for buying and
selling media on a b2b basis we believe
we've built that and we believe that
we're uniquely positioned to actually
have it get adopted at scale across the
industry kochava
presently measures about 7 billion USD
in digital advertising annually
we're tracking about a million clicks a
minute worldwide we have about 60
different points of presence where we're
collecting post install or post
conversion activity clicks impressions
and we're gluing all that together we
have a separate product called free app
analytics free app analytics actually
gives us first-party data that we also
license for targeting to the tune of 2.7
billion device IDs worldwide of those
2.7 billion device IDs we've got roughly
a billion 5 monthly active users that's
comparable to Facebook that's something
that you can apply at scale in the
context of blockchain and actually get
it to be quite useful
we've got geo targeted precision GPS
data on roughly 187 million of those
devices and the point is is that all of
this together between our customer list
our capabilities on measurement and our
capabilities of being the trusted third
party between both supply and demand
give us a very unique position to
actually get this adopted versus a
handful of very smart people in a garage
who hope to change the world but we
really have the capacity to change
so the concept of digital advertising is
really simple you have an advertiser who
spends money with a publisher to present
an ad to an end user with the hope that
that user will go do something about it
with that advertiser the reality is this
is what digital advertising looks like
for mobile today it is not as simple as
that
and because of that difficulty Google
and Facebook have dominated over the
last number of years there is an ability
today to unify the frustration around
transparency and the difficulty of a
splintered market so that advertisers
think of three places where they want to
buy it scale Facebook Google and
Exchange so we've got a number of really
unique capabilities within our platform
we're a real-time systems company we've
we've been that kind of company as a
bootstrapped and profitable business for
seven years and so we took this problem
of digital advertising and we solved it
very technically in terms of a high
performance high transaction volume
system that also has really interesting
aspects around distributed file systems
a concept called a daily rolling chain
channel support what many people call
kind of two-way pegged chains a
multi-dimensional chain with a
randomized delegated proof of stake
model so we can handle the volumes of
transactions involved in digital
advertising and obviously the notion of
the insertion order which is the
contract for which you buy digital media
actually being a smart contract and in
that process actually managing and
watching the workflow of the the
negotiation and discovery of inventory
or demand the settlement into a smart
contract the assertion that an ad was
served rated measured and paid for and
so that end-to-end process today
is largely paper-based in our industry
and if electronic it is very mote
centric in other words certain vendors
have certain connectivity to other
vendors so we come up with some
interesting and novel concepts like a
notion of a proof of ad serve so we have
ad serving minor technology this is
effectively a next generation CDN
specifically for ad delivery which also
provides asserted ad delivery through an
independent verified third party and
then finally we have a number of
different examples of how money movement
happens either through tokens themselves
or through what we call payment
providers in this example you've got a
buyer and a seller of a smart contract
to transact on media and there is no
measurement provider there is no payment
provider there is no ratings provider
it's just Wild West that's totally fine
in this protocol and tokens get changed
from the the buyer to the seller the
system also supports the ability to have
these market driven Oracle's like for
example an ad measurement company like
kochava or a viewability ad measurement
company like a mote who could stand in
this place and be an Oracle on the
system and represent their marketability
their market driven expertise and be the
triggering effect of payment so the same
buyer and seller engage in a contract ad
is delivered but because the contract
includes the requirement for measurement
kochava asserts that this off chain
transaction is measured and then
therefore on chain and on the ledger and
that's what releases the token sale that
the token distribution and then finally
and this is really important everyone in
this room really appreciates and
understand the value of crypto agencies
and holding companies these big big
companies that buy and sell lots and
lots of media they're not gonna have a
crypto wallet anytime soon and so we
designed into the system the capacity to
have an embedded payment provider
and so someone who's used to paying
Accounts Payable to buy media can
continue to pay through Fiat Accounts
Payable to buy media and there can be an
entire ecosystem of payment providers
who accept Fiat and then transact the
tokens on the network so we've designed
that kind of liquidity directly into the
system which not only provides great
capacity of demand for tokens it also
provides a faster method of adoption for
the ecosystem so this last slide and
I'll be finished at this slide and again
here all night so what would love to
talk to anyone that has any questions
this is a representative example of the
top call at 20 different publishers and
ad networks that we have integrated into
kochava it gives you a sense of how much
spend happens on a monthly and a yearly
basis we have roughly 3,600 different ad
networks that we have any rated into
into kochava again seven billion dollars
and spend what's what's interesting and
unique about media and you really have
to get your head around this think of
any other business other than in-app
purchases where the delivery of the
service is friction free you buy ads the
ad is shown and your service has been
delivered everything is electronic
friction free very few industries other
than again in-app purchases or
subscription services for things like
video on demand very few services are
that friction-free
an industry that is a two hundred and
fifty billion dollar market that is as
screwed up and disjointed is digital
advertising that has a technology vendor
like kochava already is a demonstrable
leader as a as a representative
third-party this is ripe with
opportunity and I would love to have
anyone that wants to join us on this to
join us and to fight and win
so thank you
[Applause]

mmm so I want to apologize first for my
sexy voice today that's not my intention
I'll try to speak loud but if you have
any problem hearing me please raise your
hand or just make a gesture telling me
to speak loud I'll try my best so an
answer you love - a pang of Smita so
then you hear ago hamnida my name is
hope you'll hear a lot well I'm the
co-founder and CEO of Xing Xing Xing
training where export/import on the
blockchain we're building the first
public blockchain the supports privacy
scalability as well as security for
enterprise to build supply chain
applications we have been start building
our technology from MIT Media Lab since
2015 and so far we have run 8 rounds of
large-scale has net for our block team
across 14 regions in real time not
simulation and we're developing our
first probe concept with the sourcing
platform in China who has 30,000
existing small and medium sized business
users today I would like to take the
opportunity to explain everyone
why would we're doing is important why
it's related to everyone's life and how
our technology can help to solve the
problem is it loud enough ok so and if
you think about what is supply chain
traditionally supply chains are divided
into three parts sourcing produce and
deliver so in the past few hundred years
entire process change a lot so we used
to meet each other face to face and make
the goods by hand and then deliver the
goods with I don't know trucks but
nowadays we search each other's profile
online and use machine to make goods and
use even helicopter and drone to deliver
the goods so if you think how much the
supply chain has changed the supply
chain management hasn't changed that
much at all in the past 400 years
as a matter of fact every year there's
around five trillion dollar potential
loss for shareholders in global supply
chain because of the inefficiency and
and the lack of connectivity so now I'm
gonna basically try to use three
examples to explain why you meet some of
those difficulties in your life and how
are those related to the supply chain
the first problem I want to talk about
is the inefficient process so at this
point in 2018 it takes six pounds of
paperwork to complete a global trade
from beginning to the end and even when
you are using systems most of the system
are not compatible to each other so
that's why when you check your other
record in different systems you'll find
that different records in the order and
inventory and then the account
receivable platforms that's why and the
second problem I want to address is the
exclusion of small and medium-sized
business so according to the IFC
estimation every year there's about 1.6
billion dollar I met trade finance need
primarily driven by small and
medium-sized business if you're a big
company like Apple IBM there's no
problem but if you're a small guy and
you have been trading with your buyer in
the past three or five years you know
that you have delivered the quality
goods you know that the buyer is happy
about you however the record is only
kept between you and the buyer you
cannot use that transaction record to a
new buyer to prove that about your
reputation and for a small sized
business with like annual revenue around
$1,000,000 they have to accept the
payment terms such as 60 to 90 days from
big companies there have no negotiation
room at all as a matter of fact in China
alone there are 40 million small and
medium-sized business who who are short
of financing because with all the assets
including including fixed asset account
receivable payable as well as inventory
the bank only recognized we only
recognize fixed asset which are houses
the cars that you can use as collateral
because they are not because they are
not able to track where this other come
from and who actually you're selling to
in the end so because of this issue
there are lots of small business that
have problem scaling their business or
even went bankrupt so sometimes you
order the goose and you realize that
okay so I can't receive it in the end
and my upstream supplier or some of the
buyers went bankrupt it because their
cash cash flow of change the chain cash
flow broken so all of this related to
the problem that we talked about lack of
transparency the lack of transparency in
the entire global supply chain is
essentially an information problem so
this is why in the past few hundred
years so what have been doing in the
past 400 years we go to agent right so
we're we're relying on centralized agent
to tell us who should we trust who
should we treat with weather who should
be entitled for credit where this other
actually comes from so that creates the
entire inefficiencies in the global
supply chain that upstream don't know
what's going on was that real demand in
downstream and downstream don't know
what is the image rest agency upstream
so if you other same goals you'll find
delivery time very different in several
occasions that's because there is
information transparency issue across
the entire supply chain so the good news
is that all the big companies nowadays
have realized oh great blockchain could
be the magic so we have been seeing lots
of innovations around this area in the
past one or two years so the innovation
was IBM and mercy we're trying to track
the shipment record as well as the
custom records through blockchain so two
days earlier I read the news about
Samsung SDS was trying to use blockchain
technology to track their shipment as
well and for supply to financing so
Foxconn has already has already
penetrated
- there - tier 1 and tier 2 suppliers in
China and the aiming to penetrate and
kill their ace tier of supplier so
everyone has come to the realization
that okay so in the global supply chain
and global trade could be the use case
that blockchain can solve because of the
trust because of the trustless
infrastructure as well as the fault
tolerant database nature that's great
but the question is have we seen who has
so far who has used in your real life
who has used a black shampagne's product
that improved your day-to-day life so
far no one and none of those companies
have passed proof of concept stage and
why anyone can guess why I think
actually June touch base and a few of
the points early on so I won't repeat
all of them so the first thing about
public chain which student actually
mentioned a lot there are lots of
instability in the public chain right as
a company you can't really run your
transaction on the public blockchain
when you don't know what will be the
throughput or warping what would be the
cost tomorrow also there is no privacy
on the blockchain at all so as a
business especially for some of the
large companies who are listed company
right there they really cannot risk
being risk to expose who they are
trading with and what have been doing
through the public watching so that is
the privacy issue and then the second
issue it's about it's about security
okay so companies don't trust public
blockchain because there are so many
issues on public watching great so then
what are other companies doing now right
they are either launching a private
chain or consortium chain with 10 20 100
500 notes something like that well I
kind of say not every use case should be
put on the public blockchain right so if
you are launching a blockchain or
database with all the parties that you
trust already also
like pound it legally let's example all
of your employees right they have signed
legally binding contract that they
should do something and you're just
using them using the blockchain to
improve their efficiency that's good but
global supply chain is an entire like
trustless environment that you don't
know who you are trading with and you
don't know like the person who's on the
other side of ocean whether they tell
when they tell you the ship the goods
they actually do that or not right so
that's why for the private chain and
concerning chain is not really
applicable if we're if we're trying to
solve the problem that I just mentioned
now that I just mentioned earlier and
then the third problem is not only about
blockchain it's more on Enterprise
related thing so think about if a listed
company like Cargill they have five
million invoices every year so are you
gonna if you tell them that I implement
the blockchain blockchain application
are you gonna tell them to manually
input all the five million invoices on a
platform obviously not so the existing
blockchain solutions also didn't find a
way to actually integrate with the
existing infrastructure and also there
are governance issue so a company cannot
just let the developers have their
private key to try to send their
transactions you basic cannot because
the private key will control the ledger
the database essentially are trying to
leverage in the blockchain so you can't
let the private key flying around
you can't let everyone sign that
manually you need to have a scalable
infrastructure that's not only for
blockchain that's for any enterprise
architecture any enterprise
infrastructure so all of them have not
been solved yet and the good news is
that we believe we have found a solution
to address all those issues so we are
the first public blockchain that that
brings privacy scalability as well as
security so I'm just gonna dive in a
little bit a little more about each
point how we are achieving privacy
scalability as well as security so
privacy our blockchain code base is
based on
quorum which is co-developed by JP
Morgan and Z cash so that there is a
privacy layer on on Quora there is a
privacy there in quorum what it does is
that your your wallet ID your particular
public key has to be included in the
private full-function in that smart
contract so that you and whoever who
else private key I included can use
their private key to decrypt the payload
information the smart contract to seem
to make it simple so if you don't
mention okay if you don't mention hope
in that smart contract I will have known
that will become a private invitation
only smart contract that I will never
have visible have visibility to so
basically the quorum blockchain the
entire network only reach consensus on
transaction hash as well as the state of
public voce so the for the private smart
contract only the participants whose
keys are included in that particular
smart contract will have will reach
consensus so that everyone is on the
same block chain but some participants
get the benefit of private smart
contract so the privacy layer is
basically a military-grade of security
privacy security level that's why even
when they have Exim chain collapse or
touchwood or we have or the entire
protocol broken your information is
still secure as long as you don't lose
your private key
that's the privacy layer and then in
terms of the scalability so at this
moment we have done eight rounds of
large-scale network testing that our
blockchain is currently running with
protocol real-time not simulation with
600 notes 250 machine across 14 regions
in several big data centers around
entire world so all the work now is open
source you can check on our public
github for our large skill network
testing so what we're developing is we
call it infrastructure as code meaning
that used our infrastructure tool or our
infrastructure code you can manage and
deploy
enter
prai's ready blockchain not only
globally distributed also with with also
with Charlotte vote where you can get
end to end encryption to manage your
keys in a scalable way and also network
monitoring tool called terraform which
will basically monitor your entire
network performance and make sure that
when some servers are done and the other
servers app so all of those things that
we're doing now is for enterprise
because if I'm an individual right I'm
happy running a node today tomorrow if I
I'm in love with another blockchain I
just close this down and leave it there
but when you're running a business you
can't just shut the business like when
there's Network issue or when there are
like server issue so everything we're
doing now basically it's the entire
package offered to enterprise that if
tomorrow you want to be ready to use
tomorrow you have it the last thing
about its security huh so security this
is actually addressing all the problem
about consortium chain where where as
how can you ensure your network security
while you bootstrap the network from 500
to 2,000 or 220 thousand nodes how can
you balance the network security as well
as the the network skill right so
basically what we are developing it's
kind of unique so we are using a
federated consensus model and a
quadratic voting based governance
mechanism I know this doesn't make any
sense right so that's why next I'm gonna
explain what this means
so we're doing a voting base consensus
algorithm so when it comes to voting so
basically you have to answer the
question who to vote what to vote and
how to vote right so basically our
initial voters right so initial group of
voters and they take there basically
will be selected from our initial talk a
hodor's world which which are the honest
and trusted a network that we have
already validated so if they want to
become the master vote the master node
they basically have to pass kyc have a
dedicated IP
tress have a minimal amount of our token
able to run 24 hours a day without more
than one hour connection loss so they
need to have certain criterias but then
those are their identities but then what
what can they do so basically we'll have
each different covenant cycle last of
example every two weeks
those entire network will vote in one
note who will be able to have the who
are qualified to propose a block so
meaning that whether you are qualified
to propose a block or not that depends
on whether the entire network vote you
in or vote you out so that means if lots
of example by when we start when we
start launching the midnight we have
2,000 nodes and the governance circle
the voting circle is two weeks then it
would take about if you want to take
over the network you basically need to
go through like 25 years and coordinate
with 600 parties to achieve that which
we believe during that 25 years someone
will find out that they're trying to do
that so that is what to vote the the
voting topic basically is who get to
propose a block so and then then how to
vote right so how do punch token so we
are actually the first one experimenting
quadratic voting quadratic voting pays
smart contract meaning that if you want
to put one vote you bought one token if
you want to put two votes you bound for
tokens so at the end of each voting
cycle the entire token in the pool will
get distributed evenly so if you don't
care about the topic you are still
motivated to make one vote because you
will get more than one token a little
bit more than or a lot more than one
token if other people have stronger
opinions right so you lose your opinion
but you also win the token well for
someone who can actually express
themselves we really want to express
themselves and really care about the
topic so they basically pay more tokens
so they win the vote but they lose the
tokens so that basically is developed by
the
in prison whose name is Glenn Wu in
order to implement a democratic voting
environment so we're actually in the
we're actually the first in the
blockchain space to experiment that so
this is pretty exciting
and that basically helped us to keep the
balance between the liveness of the
community as well as the network
security okay cool so basically we talk
about our blockchain
so we aim to let our blockchain become
the public park chain where all the
global supply chain business trusts our
database trust the public database as an
immutable ledger and record their proof
of business record so that in the future
they can bring those records to the
lender to the banking to their logistic
providers or to the buyers they want to
pitch to show their credibility so I
have been pitching this idea to small
and medium-sized businesses 2015 and the
lesson I learned is that do not pitch
poaching to small and medium-sized
business so the reason why we believe
supply chain is actually gonna be the
first industry that adopt the blockchain
technology without everyone knowing
because we believe it's similar like
Internet so I'm sure like your mom and
your dad use Internet but maybe not not
every one of them understand how tcp/ip
works right so the idea is that we are
working with the existing centralized
service providers in each different
field into a graphic location quality
assurance order management and shipping
so we are basically building the
blocking infrastructure for them so that
the users they're having on their
platform to see the magic the new
functionality without knowing that okay
without having to understand okay
what does peer to peer network and as
metric cryptography means so that is our
that is our goal and with the data that
we mentioned the proof of business
record that you can use to show everyone
in the trusted database you can have you
can develop so many kind of applications
either to show to your buyer
banking potential lighters there are so
many things that you can do to bridge
the five trillion dollars in
efficiencies potential lands in the
global supply chain and besides despite
our own roadmap we plan to throw lots of
hacker songs and developer event to
encourage people to leverage our
plotting infrastructure to build supply
chain to solve those heart problems in
global supply chain okay I think now
about half of my presentation this is
the time that everyone will probably
start checking their code head so I'm
gonna talk about something more light
and no more quadratic voting and oh and
the normal block to infrastructure talk
about how I actually got into this space
so I actually am not sure you a secret
I actually count that on Google hug hug
Oaxaca Senor Sunita
that's why but money and so true love's
Mita to some NIDA so after the beyond
upon who so I joined ups operations in
Beijing Hong Kong and Singapore where I
spent seven years handling cross-border
transactions where I actually learned
that Wow the banking system is really
fragile your credit is not safe your
bank balance is it's not safe in a way
and there are just so many efficiencies
I realized my job it's just operating on
efficiencies and I always know that one
day if information technology is
advanced enough I would lose my job so
in 2015 when I was sitting my desk in
Singapore where I was managing
cross-border transactions for 14 years
and for know for 14 countries I said I
thought that okay maybe if I don't break
bad maybe I'm too old so I just decided
to quit my job and went to MIT for my
MBA degree which I decided to look for
the next disruptive technology and was
really fortune and unfortunate at the
same time that I learned the blockchain
password the first class I went in MIT
Media Lab and unfortunate us that that
basically make me you know
kept me in the bankrupt Staters for the
next like two and a half years because
no one was like really listening to us
at that point and I was also like using
the wrong approach to actually pitch the
heart technology to the end users the
small business who are used to do
business in their way for like 20 years
and the technology was not there yet so
we were so broke that there was once I
had $5 in my bank account
and I actually lost my first co-founder
his name is John kisaku he's not the
co-founder of the project enigma which
is also an MIT incubated project so that
was really hard I'm fortunate that I
just jump into the rabbit hole the first
time I heard about this technology but
the really fortunate part is that it
gave us really early foot into the game
so right at this moment there are some
sea level managers and strategies in
global fortune 500 companies they would
like change their flight schedule just
come to either myself or CTO as for
strategy as for our opinion in the
industry that they are in because we
have been building relationship and
people know that we're out there for a
while so in 2016 when we went through
the plug-and-play accelerator it was
actually with some of them some of the
oldest blockchain companies so that just
gives us credibility and so and I was
really fortunate to meet my current CTO
when in my second year so and yeah I
just basically I stopped listened to the
classes I stopped going to classes since
the day that I started working on this
project I was thinking about deferring
the the deferring the school but I
realized that we need the MIT student
loan to keep running the business so and
my professors who are really amazing
people like Michael Casey who is the
under on the port of Quinn desk Simon
Johnson who is advising cryptocurrency
policy for many countries and Kristin
cutter Lilly who initiated giving
Bitcoin to MIT students in 2013 they
basically have been telling me okay hope
Goran
project will give you independent study
score so that's how I graduated from MIT
and similar how I graduated from yonder
where I just eat Korean food and watch
Korean drama so I'm never like like a
hardcore class guy so but but but quick
flash over okay so since since we
graduate myself and my CTO graduated
since last year we have making so much
progress so at this point we are pretty
confident about the testing result our
large skill has net and we're also were
basically coaching some of the fortune
500 companies giving them coach to teach
them how to use our tool to launch a
globally decentralized block to
infrastructure with privacy with key
management tool with API connection
armor ball chain so and next week we
actually didn't release the tutorial
video that I was just talking about this
I was talking about Oh launching the
satellites function with the Charlotte
vote with the network management or
we're gonna have a theory of travel
videos coming out next week so please
stay tuned and since I have a special
connection with career although we
haven't announced any of our partnership
today I'm just I'm happy to give you a
sneak peek about to do a live demo and
give you a sneak peek about the first
pearl of concept we are doing now
unfortunately I can't announce the name
yet but I can quickly show you how we're
basic using boxing technology to help
small and business small mini assess
business without them knowing that
they're using blockchain
okay let's try this finger cross
okay closed Mike let's
okay running low battery let's let's try
yes yes single cross
by the way it was my voice loud enough
okay okay okay maybe to avoid wasting
time I'll introduce my team while it's
loading
so my CTO his name is Juan well I met
him in the MIT corridor he was building
his Bitcoin casino so I'm glad that I
brought him on board doing more legit
thing so he's been coding since 13 years
old and yeah he's like a good hacker I
think yeah yeah so like some of the the
hash guys were in the was that Luca
challenge right when the one was in the
Berlin last last month
and and he was he was asked to take the
challenge to prove that he has a legit
supply chain use case and every time
other people reads a valid point he
needs to take a shot of whiskey so
apparently he was not drunk in the end
so meaning that yeah he's technically
legit ok ok ok sorry now oh ok ok ok
connect finish the team introduction ok
ok ok but I'm happy to show it it's on
my phone now I'm happy to show it to
people later ok cool so yeah and so
that's my CTO and like so he is really
am but he has been coding since 13 years
old and we understand that we need
people who can speak the company's
language who understand how to deal with
the supply chain companies and also have
years and years of experience dealing
with their senior executive managing a
product deliver that supports those
fortune 500 companies
that's where we got our head of business
arcattack who spent 14 years in IB I'm
doing what I was describing and I met
him at a really lucky day
so when during the old time when no one
wanted to listen to blockchain I had to
tell everyone about it without stopping
so I once brought my uber driver for a
sales interview and James I actually
hired him while he was my Airbnb host I
told him to stop doing Airbnb since now
we have a lot of work better work to do
but James and Giada have a combination
of 55 years in global supply chain so
though they are people who can that the
people were bringing into balance the
the technology and well as the business
development and all the other all the
other developers they also MIT graduates
and Andrew he's actually a Korean
American so he is in our newly-created
telegram current hologram channel ready
to answer everyone's technical questions
in Korean yes so I have lots of advisors
for the sake of time I'll not go through
all their background but they've been so
traumas to my advisor my first
co-founder so they've all been with us
since almost 2015 and so this is my this
is my contract okay this is my contact
and I'm happy to show you the demo
offline once if you're interested just
use this opportunity want to promote
organization which is run by my
marketing lead whom Yoli she she's
Korean unfortunately I'm not so we're
running this so she's run this she
blockchain there's Asia to promote
female entrepreneurship so we realized
that the female participation in
blockchain is really really low I think
in Korea I actually see a much better
situation so when I was in Japan
presenting an event so there were like
two speakers out of 30 32 speakers but
we think this space needs more attention
so we do host events here so we're here
as well so I have a Facebook page if
anyone is interested in joining and
there's so what I heard is that so many
girls they're afraid that they won't be
able to get the technical details and as
as easy as the guys so I want to tell
one that I had really studied Korean as
my undergrad major and I didn't touch
math since eighteen years since 18 years
old and I didn't learn coding one day so
I can still lead the hackers so there is
no excuse for anyone not participating
oh okay so good on axiom chain telegram

mr. Pardo kita has keep alum NIDA comes
out NIDA adhigam German pocket Sunita I
can take your question all right
I think yeah oh yeah your question okay
the last part is not important
sure maybe our answer the competition
first I actually don't really see things
as competition because like the public
first of all we built on top of quorum
which is essentially a fork of a serum
with privacy so we are forking them and
add on top of our quadratic voting
consensus which is created for
enterprise and also all of our other
like consensus algorithm I think in this
space we should like build a country
built on top of each other's work so we
are solving like a specific industry and
we've been trying to understand like how
we can help them since 2015 and we know
that we basically tailor-made this
blockchain and our consensus model as
well as all the other packages the other
packages so it's like so first time when
Steve Jobs so the computer he stole the
computer chip and he realized he needed
to have the entire computer right so we
don't really want to defend so what but
when we do client pitching we're just
saying that okay so we do prove concept
now we roundhouse net so the app on my
phone is actually running on the test
net with our client once we launch our
main main that we have all the entire
tool and also when you skill today I
want five notes tomorrow you have 500
nodes right no problem and there's no
downtime you can monitor that I mean
this like we wants to just to give it
ready to use product not a computer chip
because if you only give a blockchain
you can't really it's just a database
you can't really use it for anything
right so what we're doing some of them
are innovative but a lot of them were
like contributing on top of other
people's work to make sure that we
address the area that we understand the
pain that we have confidence to solve
the issue and quickly so quickly solve
the customer and then your question is
that then how do you onboard customer
right so my friend is not basically to
pitch to small medium-sized business so
I realized that's not my strongest suit
to explain the technology to them so
what we're doing actually so for the
probe concept partner they already have
30,000 and small medium sized business
is a sourcing platform so what we're
doing is called prove quality so all the
buyers right they hire quality assurance
company right and to do inspection
right for supply after that that data
just throw away right it's really
ashamed that that information like the
suppliers cannot use those information
to build their reputation right so we're
essentially building the proof of
quality with them so that all their
users right can have that functionality
so basically what they will see is it
did additional functionality on top of
that so that is one way we're working
with existing providers and we're trying
to keep them as straightforward as
possible especially if they have an API
we can literally like connect their API
with our Oracle database although we're
hoping that in the future it's not gonna
be us holding the API for them we're not
trying to like eat their lunch they
should be hosting their API it's do
their business
so we'll become their plot changing
infrastructure to support the proof that
they're trying to deliver extra value to
the client and the other the other side
is to partner with like some big
companies some fortune 500 companies who
have their very large scale of supplier
Network right so essentially you're
thinking about you're working with one
company you're actually using their the
Anker buys their power to onboard like a
large scale of suppliers so in a way
basically I think I was talking about
two ways but eventually it's all about
one way it's like work with the existing
platform providers or existing players
to make sure that the customers they
don't really change their their existing
flow if they are using platform hey
they're still using platform a and
they're talking to be they're still
talking to B so just like adopting
internet so we don't really want to
explain tcp/ip to everyone yeah thank
you
one more question thank you
sure I think for supply chain companies
actually relatively and easy pitch to
them based on the like efficiencies that
we're talking about less of example you
think about if we consider this as a big
fire that's about Samsung right so some
sound they have their first tier
supplier so Samsung has a contract with
this first year supply right and then
this is their second tier supplier right
so the first tier supplier in China they
can tell the bank look I have a contract
with Samsung right so give me the loan
give me the loan so that I can manage
the cash account right my cash
turnaround so the second tier they can
maybe get some long with by collateral
their house and the factory because
because the thing is this guy the second
tier supplier who provides raw material
for this guy to manufacture by to
Samsung right he doesn't have a direct
contract to Samsung right he can't tell
the bank I have a contract with this guy
and then this guy will not provide the
contract with sansa also like the
semiconductor there are thousand
millions of kinds right which other are
you talking about right because they
also produce for other buyers right so
there is no way that it was the existing
infrastructure for anyone for buyer to
track even the banker buyers they have
less visibility as long as that they
have low less and less visibility as
long as the chain goes out listen the
folks can't they have eight years of
supplier in China like every day there
are there are financing platform come to
them is this guy your supplier this this
guy's supplier I have no idea I only
contract with first year supplier but if
you think about how poor the small guys
is right the more upstream you are the
earlier you have to deliver the product
and also the later you get paid if no
one actually covers the money the cash
flow for you so it's actually a win-win
for every single person in the entire
ecosystem for suppliers they can prove
that eventually this good is actually to
a buyer right we should be able to
leverage the buyers credit to get loan
instead of putting my house or like
factory as collateral for the anchor
buyer this is actually helps them to
keep the stability of supply chain so
that is that that phone called Samsung
Galaxy Note
was the phone that explode so that you
have more more visibility about your
upstream supply chain and you they
actually they actually make a lot more
money between that because they can
offer think about how how cheap they can
get money from the bank right they can
just easily add a few like peeps right
and loan the money to their upstream
suppliers they're still making money and
that they know who are their upstream
suppliers and have more visibility and
then for the banks if you can show that
record it's much easier for them to
access the default rate of that
particular other so does it make sense I
think you I think you still have
questions yeah okay comes Hamid ah thank
you very much once again
hello everyone I'm Dan Larimer CTO of
block one I'm sorry I can't be there

good to be back in Korea I've been doing
business here for over a decade back in
2005 and 2006 I acquired a business
called item mania and then eventually
item base so I've been in the digital
currency business in Korea for some time
and I'm gonna I think that's very
important because that's what's causing
Korea to be the leading sort of market
in the world it's the fact that this was
the mecca of gaming and you know gamers
and people that understand sort of the
secondary markets or the item trading
industry were the ones best equipped to
understand this trend here and you know
it's exciting to see how Korea's leading
the world here's a a trailer for a film
that was made about the work that we
used to do which I think has led to what
you see here
I struggled for years trying to explain
what it was I was doing usually I just
say I work with video games because if I
say you know my virtual currency broker
people just kind of look at you like
what
you've got games that are based entirely
on selling the gold on Facebook virtual
worlds are creating demands and
somebody's gonna have to meet those
demands they don't somebody like me bow
was at that time that I realized that
people will spend money on virtual
things no differently than they would
for tangible things so that was kind of
that Eureka moment for me and that's
really when my company was on its way to
doing a hundred million in revenue and
they said so what you got to do you got
to take all in profit and you got to
give it to us or we're gonna see you
gonna end badly off
[Music]
and there are a lot of people
business versus family
I didn't do well this is the future in
the image
and this is happening on a massive scale
in country
China
Oh
[Applause]
Powerman
the real and the virtual
[Music]
but I always looked at this as something
that could go poof instantly so this is
a film that comes out this year so my
background was in virtual worlds and now
we're doing this in the real one so a
couple of quick things what's driving
this trend I started blockchain capital
which was the first venture fund in the
space and our our logo is a digital
starfish it's a great book if you want
to study decentralization called the
starfish and the spider do you know what
happens when you cut the leg off a
spider it walks with a limp if you cut
off another leg more of a limp you cut
off its head it's dead but with a
starfish if you cut off one of these
legs it grows back if you cut off one of
these legs with any part of the center
of the starfish that will become an
entirely new starfish if we cut it five
ways through the center it will become
five starfish so this is the best
example of sort of decentralized systems
that exist in nature and that's a big
part of what's happening is here the
world is moving away from centralized
systems to distributed and decentralized
systems and it's that trend combined
with proprietary software becoming
open-source software the open source
movement has already been one where we
know it's a superior methodology of
development but it took a very long time
for the open source movement to really
find that exponential growth curve and
it's being driven by this technology and
that's because historically if you
wanted to work on open source systems it
was voluntary it was something you would
do to contribute your time you know
because you believed philosophically and
what might be built or you wanted to you
know do something cool and get some
credit but when you're not compensated
it's hard for people to devote their
lives to the open source movement the
block chain or the tokenization of
Technology and protocols is what's
created the financial incentive where
you
make more money working on decentralized
open source systems than you can working
at Facebook or Google and it's it's that
tokenization the ability to essentially
own part of call it the IP or of these
technologies that's driving this and
we're also moving away from call it
proprietary ownership of things to
shared assets so it's the combination of
these three trends that are driving
everything that we're seeing today it's
worth noting that uber is the most
successful taxi company in the world but
doesn't have any cars Facebook is the
largest media company in the world but
it doesn't create any content Alibaba
the largest retailer in the world but
has no inventory
Airbnb the largest provider of
accommodations but doesn't own any rooms
and bitcoin is now the fastest-growing
bank in the world but with no employees
or branches and the other thing that's
interesting is all of these centralized
ones the first four those are becoming
market opportunities for anyone that
wants to go there last year was kind of
the year of AI SEOs and towards the end
of the year it became all about Forks
it's worth noting that Forks are a good
thing forking is you know what provides
for that you can't have bad leadership
if someone decides to run a project in a
way where we the community feel that the
leadership is not doing things the way
that we'd like we always have the option
to fork it so forking is basically
evolution every one of us is a fork of
our parents you know and so you have
contentious Forks and then you have
non-contentious Forks but these are
actually good things and they lead to
the progress that we're seeing so what
you know what are the big things that
are driving all that we see here one is
that you've seen call it consumer sort
of adoption we're seeing I think
probably a 10x growth this year
exponential and then also on the the
corporate side you're seeing the use of
stuff so what are the big drivers here
one is you've got places with major
inflation Venezuela Argentina obviously
you've seen cash being eliminated in
markets
the world Africa that do you know what
the sort of leading payment market in
the world is for mobile it's it's
actually Kenya Kenya's the leading
country in the world for payment
technology and that's because they
didn't have incumbent infrastructure and
so you're gonna see in places like
Africa Latin America and Southeast Asia
huge growth you know places like India
over the course of this year and
obviously places with currency controls
and now you've seen all the world's
major financial institutions what's been
driving the price more than anything
these days is the consumer adoption that
you're seeing happen massive growth
occurring there but also all the major
financial institutions of the world have
essentially bought in and you're
starting to see them actually buy tokens
the major institutions are coming in and
I think we're gonna see more of that
over the course of this year because
it's more or less all of them some of
the the blockchain technologies that are
coming out this year we're going to see
the promise of what the blockchain can
do actually deliver you know
historically we've been more in these
prototype phases where we can't do
anything at scale there's fees and
that's all going to change this year
which means that the financial
institutions are going to go from
running on pilots to actually full
implementations of this technology and
it's a global phenomenon historically
California or the west coast of the
United States is where most of the
world's innovation occurred and the
reason for that is that the the capital
formation the financing or money
available to entrepreneurs and
innovators was primarily on the west
coast of the United States what you're
seeing now is entrepreneurs anywhere in
the world have access to capital it's no
longer just that west coast of the
United States or some of these other
markets if a genius is born in Africa or
Eastern Europe or anywhere in the world
at this point you know if the next
Einstein or the next Dan Larimer you
know can occur you know can come from
anywhere
innovation is now able to come from
anywhere on earth so it's you know
pretty important thing every major VC in
the world is in you know in terms of
money that's flown into the market VC
started funding actively in 2013 more so
in 2014
and even more so in 2015 but what
happened in 2016 is it went flat
and that's what drove the ICO market
which in the first year you saw 64 icos
raising a little over a hundred million
dollars excluding the Dow what the Dow
did even though it's an example of what
not to do make sure that you've done
sufficient security audits not once but
twice but what it demonstrated to
entrepreneurs around the world is this
isn't kind of the thing for people that
couldn't raise money from VCS it
demonstrated that this model has the
ability to scale and the best
entrepreneurs said rather than taking
money from top-tier disease I'd prefer
to do an ICO and the Dow is what
basically signaled the market and
demonstrated that that's possible
obviously huge amounts of capital here
that are coming in and that's going to
basically bring about the end of VC I
mean this this data point is my favorite
which is that token sales token
offerings are vastly exceeding now for
the early-stage the amount of capital
coming to entrepreneurs the other thing
that's worth noting is I think 2018 is
going to be largely about security
tokens and these are tokens that are not
just utility but have potentially
royalties dividends rights ownership and
so blockchain capital was the first
issuance of a security token last year
and I think you're gonna see a ton of
that this year I think that that will be
the biggest trend in 2018 and I think
that certain like 2019 security tokens
will exceed that of utility tokens and
that might even happen this year one of
the other things people like to ask is
are we in a bubble I I think it's worth
setting the context with the Internet as
an analogy so the Internet at its height
during the late 90s reached a seven
trillion dollar market gap and that was
when it was a primarily Western
phenomenon and that's not adjusted for
inflation I think I could make an
argument that that number if it were
global and inflation adjusted is
somewhere between fifty and a hundred
trillion
so we start thinking about the context
relative to that market you can see in
the bottom left here we're just at the
very beginning of this curve relatively
that doesn't mean we're going to see
cycles of prices going up and down the
price is the primary barometer of
sentiment and it doesn't necessarily
always track the fundamentals and
clearly we're going to continue to see
emotions in the market but relative to
the Internet we're still very very early
and I think this is a technology that's
going to impact the world probably 10
times more than the Internet has I think
that this is also worth noting you know
historically we've lived in this sort of
world where money is power
but we're undergoing a paradigm shift
and that is that money is not going to
be power in the future anymore it's
going to be technology is powering
consciousness is power money is
something that's being reinvented I like
sharing this because for any of you
that's in this space the most important
thing I would encourage you to look at
when evaluating these decentralized
autonomous communities is that these
things are communities first and
foremost and it's about you know how
building a community to support that
community and getting as many people
involved as you possibly can and to do
that requires nurturing your community
so you want to really look at community
leadership because that's what these
systems are I like this as a a little
lesser ship than making a movement then
let's watch a movement happen start to
finish in under three minutes and
dissect some lessons first of course a
leader needs the guts to stand alone and
look ridiculous but what he's doing is
so simple it's almost instructional this
is key you must be easy to follow
now here comes the first follower with a
crucial role he publicly shows everyone
else how to follow
notice how the leader embraces him as
Annie
so it's not about the leader anymore
it's about them plural notice how he's
calling to his friends to join in
she takes guts to be a first follower
you stand out he brave ridicule yourself
being a first follower is an
underappreciated form of leadership the
first follower transforms a lone nut
into a leader if the leader is the Flint
the first follower is the spark that
really makes the fire now here's the
second follower this is a turning point
it's proof the first has done well now
it's not a lone nut' and it's not two
nuts three is a crowd and the crowd is
news a movement must be public
make sure Outsiders to see more than
just the leader everyone needs to see
the followers because new followers
emulate followers not the leader now
here come two more people than three
more immediately now we've got momentum
this is the tipping point and now we
have a movement as more people jump in
it's no longer risky if they were on the
fence before there's no reason not to
join in now they won't stand out they
won't be ridiculed and they will be part
of the in-crowd if they hurry and over
the next minute you'll see the rest who
prefer to stay part of the crowd because
eventually they've been ridiculed for
not joining and ladies and gentlemen
that is somehow a movement is made so
let's recap what we've learned if you
are a version of the shirtless dancing
guy all alone remember the importance of
nurturing your first few followers as
equals making everything clearly about
the movie did not you
be public be easy to follow but the
biggest lesson here did you catch it
leadership is over-glorified guess it
started with the shirtless guy and he'll
get all the credit but you saw what
really happened it was the first
follower that transformed a lone nut
into a leader there's no movement
without the first follower see we're
told that we all need to be leaders but
that would be really ineffective the
best way to make a movement if you
really care is to courageously follow
and show others how to follow when you
find a lone nut doing something great
have the guts to be the first person to
stand up and join in we're all
superheroes and what I mean by that is
we all have talents and if you don't
know what your superpowers are yet I
encourage you to spend time thinking
about this and your superpowers are the
skills that you've uniquely refined over
the course of your life and it's about
figuring out what those things are and
then figuring out how to go give those
gifts to others you know life is about
figuring out you know what you're good
at
developing those skills in such a way
that you're able to then go contribute
that to others and the communities that
you believe in I like to talk about this
as well which is this concept of a
billionaire to me a billionaire isn't
someone with a billion dollars a unicorn
isn't a billion-dollar company to me a
billionaire is someone that's positively
impacting the lives of a billion people
a unicorn is a community that is
positively impacting the lives of a
billion people back in that paradigm
shift I think this is relevant and this
is a concept that I like to talk about
which is a key guy which is figuring out
what you're good at you know what you're
passionate about what you love and what
the world needs and when you find that
center point between those things that
you love what you're good at and what
the world needs you're finding your
life's purpose
and that's where you're gonna find those
superpowers and being able to gift them
this is another concept that I think is
important which is approaching every
situation and figuring out how to do
things as well as you possibly can
coming out of World War two America's
sort of contribution was you know being
able to produce industrially things fast
and cheap really fast and cheap but
coming out of the war what happened as
we continued making things fast and
cheap and super-sized we stopped making
things good and in the world that we're
going into it's no longer about making
things mediocre I believe we're living
in a world of mediocrity and what we
need to do is we need to start making
things as well as we possibly can and
this is this idea of continually
improving approaching every situation
and not doing things mediocre it's about
doing things as well as you possibly can
and you know we've historically if you
think of life as a game you know the
game has been architected in such a way
that it's about you know most people are
living lines where it's a focus on me
and how do I take care of me you know
but I think what we have the opportunity
here is to build a world we we can move
away from a world of scarcity and this
mentality the zero-sum game mentality
where free me to win you have to lose we
can build new systems we can create a
world of abundance and try to remember
that that it's not about me it's about
building a world of we the ico market
obviously one of the things that we can
do in that area if you're working on
things in this space is don't do what
the last person did try to figure out
how to improve on what the last person
did keep making things better keep
making it as best you can you know and a
lot of that is just around things like
transparency but try to continue to
contribute to this movement how you can
in that way does anyone know what this
is this is an event that occurs all over
the world this happens to be from Nevada
it's called Burt
you actually have a Burning Man here in
Korea as well it's been four times so
you don't have to travel to the United
States to visit this event and I think
Burning Man is basically a if you think
of the blockchain is the technology that
is decentralizing the world
I think of Burning Man culture as the
culture that basically pairs with that
and so I encourage all of you to dream
because there is no ceiling it's
entirely blue sky above us the only
limitation in life for us are the
limitations we impose on ourselves so
dream big we're building a new world
where anything is possible you know make
some magic
and operate with love is you know the
the chest ahed Rijn what you see on the
wall here and when you see the u.s. logo
is the sacred geometrical shape of the
heart you know operate from that sort of
place best intentions always let's also
not forget about taking care of Mother
Earth as we build these new systems
let's do it thoughtfully and responsibly
and make sure that we've got a place to
live and again everything is possible
get involved this was from my wedding my
wife is the founder of sense and we got
married at Burning Man an entirely
unicorn wedding and having fun like that
but I'll close this out on you know kind
of a speech that motivates me this is
from a film and it's Charlie Chaplin 77
years ago the greatest speech ever
written and the words that you'll hear
in this are just as relevant today as
they were then you know this was in the
middle of World War two
I'm sorry but I don't want to be an
emperor that's not my business I don't
want to rule or conquer anyone
I should like to help everyone if
possible Jew Gentile black man white we
all want to help one another human
beings are like that we want to live by
each other's happiness not by each
other's misery we don't want to hate and
despise one another in this world is
room for everyone on a good earth is
rich and can provide for everyone the
way of life can be free and beautiful
but we have lost the way greed has
poisoned men's souls has barricaded the
world with hate has goose-stepped us
into misery and bloodshed we have
developed speed but we have shut
ourselves in machinery that gives
abundance has left us in want our
knowledge has made us cynical our
cleverness hard and unkind
we think too much and feel too little
more than machinery we need humanity
more than cleverness we need kindness
and gentleness without these qualities
life will be violent nor will be lost
the aeroplane and the radio have brought
us closer together
the very nature of these inventions
cries out for the goodness in men cries
out for universal brotherhood for the
unity of us all even now my voice is
reaching millions throughout the world
millions of despairing men women and
children victims of a system that makes
men torture and imprison innocent people
for those who can hear me I say do not
despair the misery that is now upon us
is but the passing of greed the
bitterness of men who fear the way of
human progress the hate of men will pass
and dictators die and the power they
took from the people will return to the
people and so long as men die Liberty
will never perish soldiers don't give
yourselves to brutes men who despise you
enslave you who regiment your lives tell
you what to do what to think of what the
bill
drill you diet you treat you like cattle
use you as cannon fodder don't give
yourselves to these unnatural men
machine men with machine minds and
machine hearts
you are not machines you are not cattle
you are men you have a love of humanity
in your hearts you don't hate only the
unloved hate the unloved and the
unnatural
soldiers don't fight for slavery fight
for liberty in the seventeenth chapter
of st. Luke it is written the kingdom of
God is within man not one man nor a
group of men but in all men in you you
the people have the power the power to
create machines the power to create
happiness you the people have the power
to make this life free and beautiful to
make this life a wonderful adventure
then in the name of democracy let us use
that power let us all unite let us fight
for a new world a decent world that will
give men a chance to work that will give
youth a future and old age a security by
the promise of these things brutes have
risen to power but they lie they do not
fulfill that promise
dictators free themselves but they
enslave the people
now a despite to fulfill that promise
let us fight to free the world to do
away with national barriers to do away
with greed with hate and intolerance
let us
where science and progress will lead to
all men's happiness
soldiers in the name of democracy

very much everybody for being here
obviously we're very excited to be
having our first meetup here in Seoul
and today I'd like to spend a little
time talking to you about what I think
what we think the real future of the
centralization is in the next few years
so personally where we see businesses
moving as they move into the blockchain
and the transformation that's going to
happen and why these businesses will
naturally succeed a little bit about me
I'm originally from the US I've been
living in Hong Kong for about eight
years most of that time I've spent
working in technology on a number of
different startups I've worked in
product design and product development
and software development in areas from
real estate to certain kinds of digital
marketing back-end systems mobile
applications but honestly for me what I
really enjoy what gives me passion it
gives me great pleasure is to see
products in the hands of users
delivering value and making people's
lives better and that's what I'm excited
about when it comes to blockchain so
first let me talk a little bit about
systems that we're all pretty familiar
with this is a centralized technology
platform which is something that has
really defined most of the big
technology startups to the last few
years here are some of the names
including uber Facebook Airbnb a lot of
companies that were familiar with now
I'm going to use uber as the example so
the way that were works essentially we
have value creators so these are the
drivers the people who own the cars and
provide the rides and we have value
extractors the people who take the rides
so and the way that these two connect
basically there's the people who want to
give a ride the people who want to get a
ride and there's a centralized server
that exists that puts these two people
together
and when those two people come together
that's a value creation event so the
idea the idea behind the whole business
is that you can create enough value by
putting the extractors and the creators
together you can produce enough value
but you can take some profit out of the
system now the problem with this is that
when you end up with a centralized
server and profit coming out what you
end up with is a split between the
beneficiaries and the users of the
system so ultimately the beneficiaries
of the uber system are the people who
own Ober are the shareholders we're
trying to pull as much profit out of the
system as they possibly can and the key
point is that without that profit
bridging the gap there would be no
system so uber only exists the only
reason that we get to ride in an uber
car is because the uber company believes
they can pull enough profit out of the
system to make it worth their time this
has a couple of key weaknesses by
comparison to a decentralized company
the first piece is of course the profits
give the only reason for service so that
means that every decision that's made is
made in the context of maximizing the
profit to the shareholders not of
maximizing the value to the end user the
end user gets the minimum amount
necessary to keep the profit coming into
the system
the second piece and this really follows
the first one is that there's no user
vested interest there's no reason for me
as a rider to ever use uber and if
there's a taxi just in front of me in
Hong Kong we have taxis everywhere and
I'll be honest sometimes I call an uber
and the taxi will come by and I'll just
cancel the ride it doesn't matter to me
it doesn't profit me anything to use the
uber system so why would I stay in it in
2014 our CTO Lachlan CTO Dan Larimer
introduced the concept of a
decentralized autonomous collective or
DAC you may have heard this referred to
as a decentralized autonomous community
or company sometimes organization or Dao
and essentially this is an organization
that using decentralization using a
blockchain and open source
creates a completely different type of
company and a type of community that
keeps the value inside so why don't we
take a look at how that would work in
the case of a decentralized over we
start with the same actors we have the
value creators and the value extractors
so we still have the writers on one side
and the drivers on the other side but
unlike in the case of the centralized
uber they're actually connected through
an open-source platform that's linked
together with tokens the way that this
works is that you have an open source
piece of software each person who
participates in the system
owns a certain number of tokens so in
the case of an uber if I'm a writer when
I call my driver I'm actually
transferring some tokens to the driver
rather than transferring currency and
when I'm a driver and I want to extract
a value out of the system
I can turn those tokens I can basically
sell those tokens back to riders and
this creates a natural economy that
stays within and the real key here is
that the value that extra profit stays
inside of this network so rather than
having profits extracted and brought out
to shareholders and brought out of the
system they can actually be turned back
into the system so that creates a
tremendous value creation a tremendous
value add into the system just by usage
the key for open source software and the
reason that blockchain and open source
software is so important for these
decentralized autonomous communities is
that it provides transparency audit
ability and trustworthiness and
inclusiveness so the key here are first
of all transparent the open source code
is available for anybody to audit
anybody to look at this means that when
you're getting involved in the system
you can know everything there is to know
it's not like you know when you install
a new operating system on your iPhone
you just immediately click through a 45
page long impossible to read and user
License Agreement that basically commits
you all of your house and all of your
you know generations your family's
wealth to Apple if anything goes wrong
on an open source system you can
understand everything that's available
to you which creates a level of
trustworthiness and that is real
the key is that the people don't need to
know each other they don't need to be
directly connected in order to have
trust that both actors are acting for
the betterment of the system once the
value creators and the value extractors
become the same person and they remove
the shareholders they actually become
the shareholders the beneficiaries the
incentives are not properly aligned what
this means is that there isn't one party
seeking maximum profit and another party
seeking maximum value or a maximum best
experience everybody is actually seeking
the same thing this is a radical
reinvention at how a business operates
imagine an uber where when a driver is
making a decision it's not just about
how do I get the most expensive ride
with the lowest possible fee but the
decision is actually what can I do today
to grow the value of my token what can I
do to grow the utility of the network
that I'm bought into that's a
tremendously powerful transformation and
it means that every user in the system
is essentially an owner and a
beneficiary of all of the use of that
system that creates unprecedented vested
interest so earlier when I said you know
when I'm in Hong Kong and a taxi comes
by I'm gonna cancel my uber ride because
there's no actual value to me to waiting
for that car if I'm a token holder and a
decentralized uber I have all of the
reason in the world to wait for that car
to come to me and that means that the
usage of the system goes up one of the
largest challenges and all internet
companies is not acquiring users but
keeping users engaged and by having the
company itself having the usage of the
system increase the value of your own
ownership this is an unbelievable
transformation in terms of how companies
are going to keep users engaged the last
piece is that it allows the system to
leverage a much larger pool of
innovation than has ever existed
Broc talked about this a little bit in
his talk and I want to expand on it
which is this idea that you can actually
choose the companies that you work for
and rather than being paid and currency
or in a salary you can actually be paid
in an ownership stake so if you consider
a
developer at uber today that developer
goes in and they get a paycheck and they
go home but they don't really benefit if
the company succeeds or fails how
incentivized can they possibly be to do
their best job if that person if that
developers payment is being made in the
form of tokens and moreover if that user
if that developer is electing their
choosing on their own to do something
that they are passionate about that
benefits the system then they are more
incentivized and they will produce
better code and better software what's
more it's not limited to just
development
take for example marketing if I was a
successful marketer and I had an idea
for a decentralized uber I say I've got
a wonderful billboard campaign or a
wonderful Internet campaign I can go to
the token holders of this decentralized
uber network and say here's a proposal
vote for me
I want this many tokens and then I will
use them to create this marketing
campaign unlike a traditional consultant
that marketer is now being paid an
ownership stake of the system that they
are promoting and I personally believe
that means they will do a better job
they will do a faster job and a more
complete job ultimately what that means
is that these three things aligning
incentives unprecedented vested interest
and leveraging a larger pool of
innovation will create businesses and
products that will be more efficient
smarter and out-compete
the existing centralized systems that we
have today I actually don't know how a
centralized uber can possibly hope to
compete with its decentralized
counterpart and I truly believe that in
a few years we will see decentralized
systems that completely remove the old
centralized ones that were used to today
I think that's going to be good for the
users and I think it's going to be a
very exciting time to be a product
person which is really why I'm here and
why I'm excited to talk about this I
want to talk about now one actual
example of a decentralized autonomous
collective that exists which is a
website called steam it I don't know if
people are familiar with this but steam
it is the previous project of block one
CEO Dan Larimer
and it's actually an amazing community
this is a decentralized autonomous
collective that exists to basically be a
Content platform it's like a reddit or a
medium but instead of just allowing
people to post their content because it
operates on a blockchain users are
actually rewarded for upvotes
so when people click the little upvote
this is monetized this is actual dollars
that are being transferred to the person
who creates the content this is an
amazingly transformative idea and very
quickly when schema was introduced in
2016 it very quickly rose into the top
ten thousand websites visited on the
World Wide Web
basically by everybody which is a
tremendous accomplishment steam it is
still an operating community today and
what's amazing about it is that the
people who work and post on steam it by
and large are not people employed by a
company there are people who are
passionate about this community these
are the sorts of very early-stage
websites and products but I think really
demonstrate the power of
decentralization to take on the major
players in product design tokens are the
network this is the most important
concept in a successful decentralized
autonomous collective the tokens putting
tokens on a blockchain splitting up the
ownership and putting it in a way that's
provable and auditable and trustworthy
allows for tremendous investment into
the system and there are some ways that
you can use tokens to help power the
network some of the ways that steam it
works and some of the ways that we
expect other similarly run systems to
work would be that the tokens guarantee
you a certain amount of network access
so in the case of Eos you'll need to use
tokens on an EOS blockchain to basically
lock up a certain amount of the
processing power another piece is block
producer nomination so on a steam it for
example the steam it blocks are produced
by a set of 21 elected block producers
those people are accountable to the
token holders this is part of what
allows schema to be such a fast and
efficient product by comparison to other
existing blockchain
and finally last piece is a network
admission allocation so this is really
what happens with some of the profits
that I was talking about earlier when
you capture the profits in the network
and then bring them back in now the
network itself can decide what to do
with them and it's really up to the
token holders to determine what are the
most valuable things that you can do
with the extra value that you've created
simply by usage you can if you want to
simply destroy them which will remove
all inflation you can have a completely
inflation free network if you so choose
and if you feel that that's the most
valuable way to have your network work
you can have decentralized
administration over the allocation so
the key is that you know as I said
before the marketing person can come up
and say I've got a great idea for a
particular design or the developer can
come up and decide you know this is I
want to you know the work that I want to
do and this is how much it will cost and
it's really up to the people in the
network to make the decisions yeah so
that is our view on what decentralized
autonomous collectives are going to look
like why they're going to be successful
and hopefully how they'll be disrupting
the existing Titans of Technology in the
very near future thank you very much

USA ok by hanya days huh hunger
community come you a song in me de par
Subhadra Jessica parameter designer at
block 1 and today I would like to
present you with some of the developers
updates and share some of the exciting
information about what our developers
are up to but before getting into the
updates let's lead to rate again why
we're actually building this software
where is the need coming from so if
we're gonna have a look at the current
market and the requirements of large
online companies and corporations we
will understand that there are some
requirements for the performance that is
back expected from the platform so if
we're gonna have a look at the payment
processor such as Visa MasterCard for
instance they need about twenty thousand
transactions per second to be able to
successfully and on time process the
transactions of their customers
moving on to social media only facebook
like button alone by itself needs more
than fifty two thousand transactions per
second to successfully process the
requests of the customers we're moving
to the world of exchanges and prediction
markets it's even hes going to hundreds
of thousands of transactions per second
now let's have a look at what the market
actually offers so Bitcoin offers for
transactions per second and aetherium
offers about fourteen transactions per
second shared for the whole network so
imagine facebook Visa and Nasdaq sharing
together a long queue of the requests
they need they need to go through to
allow their customers to successfully
finish their operations well that's not
really sustainable and we've identified
a large gap that we need to fill
additionally to that not just the
is what's important the application
developers need a certain level of
abstraction on top of the low-level
development to be able to successfully
and what's really important very
securely to develop their applications
so things as how many our developers
here actually do actual development so
when you do start up the application
development probably you are not really
building your MySQL or SQL database from
the get-go you actually reuse software
and the best practices that are out
there if you would be trying to
implement your own database from the
very very scratch that you acknowledge
it behind it probably you would do a lot
of security holes and a lot of problems
so then Larry meer our CTO actually
built quite a few large-scale
decentralized companies before and the
learnings from his experiences are were
fed back into the eos IL platform so yo
sao is the first blockchain operational
system that provides not just the
low-level high performance transactions
ability but also a set of the utilities
that allows developers really fast and
really efficiently and securely build
their applications additionally to that
the depot's consensus distributed proof
of stake consensus that lies in the base
of our blockchain it's very very
efficient and saves a lot of money that
doesn't go to the mining because the
consensus algorithm uses the concept of
mining so when we were building in
iterating through the development of the
platform we recognized that developers
need to a place to learn to experiment
and to evaluate the platform learn how
to code and also how to build and deploy
their applications to the blockchain
experiment with their ideas and actually
start deploying their applications
before they go to the live environment
on the live blockchain as well as
evaluate the performance but even more
than that future block producers should
have some space and environment to be
able to identify whether this blockchain
is right for them and whether they can
build business on it so our team was
working really really hard and in
December last year we released
the EEOC odone 2.0 which is the second
major iteration of our software it's it
was released on December 4 2017 it's
publicly available
it features publicly available test net
and maintained by block one for the
developers community
it was released well ahead of the
schedule almost one month ahead of the
schedule and one of the reasons why is
because the developers that were coming
to us they're not just willing to you
know experiment on the platform a lot of
businesses that did their I SEOs or like
planning business they need us to be
able to successfully build their
business so then Larimer is actually a
big fan of a feedback loop between the
developers and the block shape do
third-party developers and blockchain
developers which is actually great
because releasing the test net allows
developers to start building and then
feedback back to our development team to
improve the blockchain even more so far
since the launch we've produced more
than 1.5 million blocks and the test net
was extremely stable the features of the
eoeo Don point all included the
simulated production environment with 21
block producing nodes which is how it's
gonna be when the the the blockchain
will be launched in June to second block
time Genesis block and free talking
faucet and the free talking faucet is
the platform that allows you to actually
go and get your free test tokens to be
able to deploy your application on the
test net today as well as developers API
that allows you to create and deploy the
application to the test net the release
was tremendous success but we cannot
stop and we need to move with the speed
of light and right now our developers
team is working on us that I owed on 3.0
which is the next iteration of our
software yeoseo done 3.0 features new
features such as bandwidth and database
alberene rate limiting which is
extremely
important because it will secure our
platform from spam attacks and well as
well as will provide a guaranteed
bandwidth and throughput for the
businesses scheduled transaction so this
is a pretty unique feature that is
really interesting for future businesses
build on top of us that IO
it will allow businesses to create
scheduled transactions on the on the
type of subscription so imagine you are
decentralized Netflix at the moment on
on the majority of the blockchain
platforms the user has to go to the
platform and actively process the
payment but was with us that IO you
actually can as a developer schedule the
transactions to be automatically taken
of the users account lost password
recovery as well as hacked account
recovery in the world of Bitcoin and
etherium if you lose your private key
you essentially lose your money well
nobody really likes that on the used oil
platform you can actually if you lose
your private key or someone hacks into
your account through a system of social
interaction and also right timing your
account still may be recoverable which
is amazing
Merkel tree calculation so this is a
piece of crypto gara graphical software
embedded in in our blockchain that is
extremely important for the horizontal
scalability it will actually allow the
creation of the side chains that are
there are proved back to the main chain
500 milliseconds blocks so this is
something that will introduce in the
next iteration as well which will even
further improve the performance of our
blockchain and dozens and dozens and
dozens of other stability and
performance optimizations not just the
core platform is what we're working on
we're also working on the developers
tools and and and the ecosystem and our
main efforts a channel into direction so
one is the documentation improvements
that can be tracked through our wiki and
the main github and the other one is the
smart contract templates so smart
contract templates are basically going
to be the bootstrap platform for the
developers to be able to build their
real time real life applications in the
future
I really encourage those of you who are
developer so interested in developing on
our platform to take a photo of this
slide because this link is the tutorial
end-to-end tutorial on how to build your
real-life application and deploy it to
us test net essentially at the end of
going through this tutorial and it's
very simple and it's very it provides
information in a very chewable format at
the end of this this tutorial you will
get a deployed application deployed to
EOS test net we're also not forgetting
about the front-end integration
libraries so some time ago we've
developed an EOS Jas ECC which is a
cryptographically level library that
provides the cryptographic all functions
needed for the creation of private keys
account management etc on top of that
library we've built a o SJS which is
again a pretty low-level interface
library that allows developers to
interact with the Yost s net and in the
future with the public net and we also
started to develop USGS keygen and USGS
key store these are the high level
utilities that allow even those people
who are not very familiar with the
encryption in cryptography to still
start creating accounts for for the
users on the USGS we are aiming to allow
developers that are not very good with
the cryptography to still build very
secure applications and this is the
purpose of these libraries so I would
recommend you also to take a picture of
this page as well because these are the
main resources where you can go and read
more about our technology so obviously
our main website use that IO
where you can read about about our
company github.com slash us the i/o
which is the main github repository it
contains a lot of sub repositories it
has the source for the main blockchain
it has all the JavaScript libraries and
has a lot of documentation around it as
well if you have any developers
questions I really encourage you to send
the email to developers
block that one on the side from you know
just general technical questions and on
the side of the integration how to build
your company on top of yours all right
you also we also have a really really
vibrant telegram community so these are
the four main channels that that we are
supporting so us is the general channel
it just hit about 20,000 users recently
very very active community
Yugos developers is more technical
environment where you can ask your
developers question then Larry Moe is
quite often in that chat so if you're a
developer going ask your questions there
us block block Pro which is the main
channel for those who is inquiring about
becoming a block producer or just
interested about how it's all done and
what's the future of the integration was
that was the blockchain and ye OS gob is
the chat specialized in government
governance and Constitution and all the
philosophical conversation around that
my presentation is finished on this
really thank you

Park Subhadra juicybar Amira hi everyone
first I'd like to thank Brendon the
block one team for inviting us out to
the Yeo's Korea meetup as one of the
first and largest projects building on
yose were very excited to tell you why
we decided to build on eosin what it is
we're actually building and so I'm Sam
kaznian and I'm one of the founders of
ever pedia and what we're building is
the world's first and largest
decentralized knowledge bases which
means that it's a full encyclopedia
completely on the blockchain and so
before I actually tell you what the
tokens do and how we're building it I'd
like to go over some blockchain
technology and history and explain to
you guys why we're so excited to build
on EOS and so Bitcoin is considered as
the first blockchain 1.0 technology and
I was lucky enough to discover Bitcoin
back in college when mining was actually
easy and before it became a professional
endeavor and I did my fair share of
mining what made Bitcoin really really
revolutionary is that it was just a
simple
account balances and values and using
clever cryptography anyone that
connected to the Bitcoin network could
know what anyone else anywhere in the
world regardless of their race religion
creed nationality bank or lack thereof
had say five hundred million dollars of
value in their wallet and that was very
very revolutionary back then in the
years 2010 2011 but it wasn't until 2014
that the etherium team proposed taking
the same type of cryptography that made
Bitcoin work proposed building a shared
world computer instead of just a
database and this shared world computer
anyone who connected to the etherium
network could build applications deploy
these applications such as applications
which printed your own money or printed
stock or paid people given very specific
conditions and anyone in the etherium
network could see exactly how it worked
and shared this world computer and this
was just as revolutionary if not more
than bitcoins original promise
but if theorems around two years old a
little over and very few consumer
applications which have rich communities
built around them have not actually been
deployed on a theorem in fact when these
applications are deployed such as crypto
kitties and other applications that have
actually gotten popular they grind the
etherium network to a halt and that's
because the shared nature of the
etherium virtual machine this world
computer is very bare-bones and what
that means is it's a very simple
computing device and the truth is most
people who interact and use these rich
consumer applications use them through
an operating system operating systems
that have higher abstractions that let
you have account permissions database
read write access to blob storage and
all the features that search was talking
about before and it's presentation and
that's exactly what brought us to Yeo's
which is what we think the third
generation of blockchain technology the
first fault-tolerant virtual machine
with an operating system and governance
and so that's why we decided to build
the ever pedia Network first blockchain
encyclopedia using AES technology so
that's why we're here and we're really
excited to tell you guys what we're
building and how we're building it and
so what that repiy dia network is is
it's basically Wikipedia 2.0 but
completely open source and completely
tokenized editors are rewarded IQ for
curating articles tokens represent votes
that allow editors to govern the network
so they represent shares essentially in
this decentralized knowledge base and
having tokens essentially gets you part
of the governance process and so having
more tokens and shares has a higher
incentive to actually keep content
higher quality higher and it's a
completely democratic and open-source
process this is something that Josh was
showing us in his presentation so when
we developed the entire ever PD Network
we really took this to heart and that
value creators and value extractors
really have to be aligned in in a new
generation encyclopedia just like all of
the decentralized rich consumer
applications that are going to be built
hopefully and so this is a slightly more
technical structure of how the ever
pedia network works there's a three
smart contract system a token module
which as everyone's mainly familiar with
keeps track of token balances token
movements and the classical token
functions the article or information
module is where services content
curators editors bots ai's interact with
to actually submit data or knowledge and
either get it approved or disproved by
the stakeholders of the system the
article module then uses the IP FS
protocol which EOS has native storage
and support for to actually store the
blob articles for anyone to access and
since anyone can use the IP FS protocol
to host any of these articles it becomes
immutable and uncensored the governance
module is the third and final smart
contract that actually is part of the
ever PD Network the governance module is
used to actually propose
any changes to any of the smart
contracts including itself and so this
is built because we actually think that
the best way to be a self sustainable
and self governed decentralized
application is to allow the stakeholders
and token holders of the network to be
able to fully be in charge of commanding
the rules creating changes in deploying
new changes as more and more answers are
found about what should the actual
network look like we don't know all the
answers at the beginning but we want to
lay out the system so that it's
completely self governed just like the
platform that it's built on and so the
articles are completely decentralized in
terms of hosting they use yeoseo storage
which is what we're really really
excited to actually try out and use and
since they're collectively hosted by the
community articles are curated by the
community and token holders it's
completely immutable and uncensored bull
since anyone that hosts it can in real
time just like the cryptography that
makes Bitcoin work and stay in real time
anyone can actually serve these articles
us block producers or any ipfs node
operators and so I just want to go over
every pedia org the website that we've
built so if you go to every PD org what
you won't see is a single page splash
screen for an ICO or a token project
what you'll actually see is a complete
web application that we started in 2015
with the idea what can we do to make the
online encyclopedia better in every
single aspect and we started by
completely redoing the design and the
readability and the editing functions
and completely changing the rules and
making it an open interface where anyone
can make articles about anything and we
realized as blockchain technology got
better and more projects such as cos
were started that to really make a
completely revamped 2.0 new generation
encyclopedia knowledge base it's not
just about a website it's about the
entire back-end and the governance and
aligning incentives of editors just like
Josh was saying in his presentation and
so
devvra period org website will be the
first website that anyone can access and
access the ever pedia network that's
being built on es but we hope it's not
the only one and we don't think it will
be in fact anyone can use the EOS IO API
to access any module of the ever pedia
network submit content actually create
services get paid in tokens make
articles better and not even have to use
this website in fact other companies
have been asking us about how they can
build integration to their own websites
through their repeated Network so it's
not just about a website with token
functions and an incentive layer it's
about building a complete completely
brand-new network that any website can
plug into any service can plug into and
a completely new generation of knowledge
and so this is our founders and
executive team we actually have Larry
Sanger who's the co-founder of Wikipedia
working with us on this project it's
very exciting some very talented and
specialized team members coders and and
blockchain developers and really great
advisors that were very glad around
board and we're 13 people in total and
we'd love to talk with you and we have
the team here and very excited to be at
this meetup in Korea and I leave you
guys with this one quote from Paul
Graham in 2007 and he was one of the
best-known startup careers of this
generation and back then he was looking
for actually exactly the disruption to
Wikipedia and said there's room to do to
Wikipedia what Wikipedia did to
Britannica and we think that in 2018
with new technologies new protocols such
as ES and new communities being formed
there's finally the technology and the
possibility of actually executing on
this mission and we're very very excited
to be building it on ES thank you

hello everyone thank you for coming and
welcome to everybody who's joining us
online at home my name is Brendan
bloomer and I am the CEO of block one in
2017 about seven months ago we started a
ERC 20 token distribution and over the
course of the last seven months we have
now and I'd like to officially confirm
we brought in about 1.1 billion u.s.
dollars to block one tonight I want to
start providing a little bit more
transparency on how we're actually going
to be structuring the organization and
what our long-term goals are for
building out this ecosystem before I get
into that we have another special guest
and I'd like to welcome the ever pedia
team hey everyone were the ever pedia
team and we're really excited to make a
special announcement today at the so
Leo's Meetup and as you guys know we're
the first decentralized encyclopedia on
the blockchain and we're building it
completely on iOS technology and a lot
of people have been asking us how can we
get the IQ token and when the ICO is and
when the token sale is and we're really
really proud to announce today that in
fact there is no IC o---- and there is
no token sale and what we're doing for
the very first time is air-dropping IQ
tokens to the e OS distribution list
instead and we're really really excited
to do this and set this precedent and
give value back to the community that
actually makes the platform where we're
building on possible and we're really
confident that we're the first but we're
not going to be the only DAP to actually
do this and so we're really excited to
build on EOS and we're really excited to
set this precedent and thank you very
much
[Applause]
thank you guys very much we're excited
to have you involved in the EOS
ecosystem so Korea is a very important
market for us and we've been spending a
lot of time preparing building the
community here and as one of those as we
move forward with that process I want to
make another announcement of a leader
that we've we've established in this
market so I want to introduce Richard
Jung the former CEO of bit thumb the the
largest exchange in the world joining us
as the head of Korea I'd like to thank
you for all of you here tonight Thank
You Brandon
[Applause]
he's my honored to join the block that
one team
I'm Richard Jeong I've been working as a
CEO for numerous high-tech company such
as PTC Korea widely known as a beat'em a

wanted to witness the global game
changer building business on iOS
software to create blockchain
communities starting from IT leading
countries like Korea Korea had numerous
success on leading IT infrastructures
industries in the past years and I
continue to work with the companies and
partners in Korea to create partnerships
to become a leading blockchain community

so I want to talk a little bit about
funding I've mentioned in some informal
settings a little bit about our plans in
the past about how we're going to be
deploying capital into EOS I owe
innovation and today I want to introduce
ESPC ESPC is a program that's going to
deploy 1 billion dollars of capital into
EOS projects over the course of the next
couple of years we're now making a
formal commitment to put the majority of
the capital that's come in through the
token sale back into the innovators one
of the biggest problems with this space
today is that most of the token
generation processes are actually
destroying resources so we take a look
at Bitcoin in aetherium we're paying
tens of billions of dollars a year right
to process very few transactions in fact
in Bitcoin we're paying hundreds of
dollars of transaction per transaction
before transaction fees to the network
inflation through the token cell over
the last year block 1 has been able to
take in those resources and now we're
going to be deploying them back into the
arch preneur this is going to stimulate
more innovation right one of the goals
of their token sale was to create a fair
transparent distribution process but one
of our major goals was also to do
something that was not so destructive
from a resource perspective something
that allowed us to keep that value and
redeploy it back into the ecosystem so
want to introduce the structure that
we're going to be using to do this we
didn't we sat down and we said if we're
going to deploy a billion dollars into
eoseo projects what's the best way to do
so right how are we going to foster the
most innovation how are we going to help
those projects succeed and this is the
structure that we we have put forth this
is our block one is going to be working
with VC partners in order to deploy this
capital so it's going to be investing in
different vent lead market leading
venture capital units throughout the
world
right and in addition to block ones
capital we're gonna be bringing capital
in from those partners so it's gonna
leverage up those resources and then
drive it back into the tail end of
innovation
it's gonna give us glow at global access
to projects these VCS are already seeing
the deals they're already working with a
lot of projects and they're in an
incredible space to educate the projects
about AOS capabilities right we're firm
believers this technology is the only
technology that's going to actually
allow the blockchain to scale it's the
first technology that's going to allow
us to launch projects like steam it like
bitshares
the next Facebook the next uber
distributed communities that are ready
to disrupt the Fortune 500's a lot of
the talk over the last couple years has
been about Bitcoin has been about money
digital currency but I think that in
2018 and into 2019 the conversations
gonna just shift to Dax or distributed
autonomous collectives or communities as
we talked about earlier the partner VCS
will be further putting capital into
these vehicles so we're actually going
to be putting a lot more than a billion
dollars of capital into eoseo innovation
and we think that the combination of the
partnerships and the combination of all
this capital coming together that we've
been able to preserve through the token
sale is really going to follow really
going to drive a level of innovation
that we haven't yet seen so on January
23rd we're gonna be announcing our first
VC partner it's a little early in the
States and we have to send all that
everything out through median embargo so
we're gonna do that in a little bit
different process but it all starts now
and what we'd like you to do is reach
out to us projects VCS we're talking to
everybody although we've we formed a
couple of partnerships already we're
gonna be deploying more capital and
we're still working with VCS and
projects throughout the world so please
reach out to us our team is ready and we
want to hear from you guys it's time to
really take this this technology
mainstream and now the spotlight is on
you the spotlight is on the innovators
the people that actually take this
technology and then really build out the
next generation of our future so thank
you guys very much I appreciate it
