The first presentation will be held by Yahzee from Animal Car Brands. So, our Animal Car Brands is publicly listed. The game company is rated as one of the top 50 game companies in the world that is heavily investing in blocking games and NFTs with brand license from Formula One, Thomas and Friends, Tour among Astroboy and more. And yes, you are the chairman and co-founder of Animal Car Brands and has been an entrepreneur for over three decades in gaming. His first job was at Atari, and he was named a global leader of tomorrow and young global leader by the World Economic Forum. He is a member of the advisory board of BAFTA and a British Academy of Film and Television Arts. Please welcome, yes, you. Alright, thank you. It's a great honor and pleasure to be here. So, I'm gonna talk to you about the awesome power of NFTs and how it's gonna save the games industry. All right, so as mentioned, my name is Yatsu. I'm the chairman and co-founder of Animal Car Brands. This will be super fast. You don't have to know the details of this, but essentially, we are a traditional MOBAs game company that decided to go all-in on blockchain last year. We did 17 different blockchain investments, and one of them later on will present itself here, which is the Sandbox, which we're very proud of.
Of the projects, you know we made an investment in Lucid Site, which is basically the MOV crypto baseball and also sort of the crypto space commander project. We also recently did an acquisition where we bought basically Striking, which is fantasy sports with non-fungible tokens and sort of fantasy sports on the blockchain. And most recently, we also announced actually we did an auction for Fortress Now, but we launched a deal with Formula One or we have the exclusive rights to do a blockchain game based on a Formula One. And of course, Sandbox, but I'll let Seb discuss Sandbox afterwards. Alright, enough advertising, alright. 

So now let me talk about sort of our industry and why do we as a traditional games company feel that it is really important to be looking at blockchain. As you can see, this is one of the forecasts. Depends when you talk to our industry, you will become 130, some people say 150 billion dollar industry and that looks pretty good, right? Obviously, it looks like the numbers are growing up, but in the traditional games business, we have one problem. It's the fact that it's 6.2 percent, which is really bad news, right? It means that we are in an industry in a traditional game space that is mature and I think you can see this today already whether you look at the growth of most game companies broadly.
Around the world, it is growing, but it is growing slowly. Right when the emergence of the rapid pace of growth came, it came from a new source, and that was mobile. At the time, but now everyone has a mobile phone, so the growth is essentially stuck. One of the reasons why this growth is stuck is not because it says less 2 billion gamers out there, so it's not an issue of audience. It's because conversion from freemium, which is the business model that overtook the industry originally, was paid games, and it became freemium. Games are around 1.5 percent in some cases - and if it's really good, 3 percent conversion. And you can see that when you analyze the financial reports of all of the major listed companies that do basic in mobile games. They talk about, you know, there are P Dow and their conversion rates. So why is it that when someone plays a game, 99 or 98 percent actually don't spend any money? Most people actually play for free, and only a small number convert. So there are many reasons, but one of the reasons I want to surmise, particularly in the games that have economies, is the fact that an example here's Lineage, which of course everyone in Korea knows really well, is a legendary game. One of the very first super successful MMOs and since 1998, seven or eight years ago, had already raked.
In close to 2 billion dollars, which back then was a very large number in gaming because the audience wasn't that big. But despite all of its success, in the same year they shut down their US server. Now, how does a product that makes two billion dollars globally, but then they shut it down in the US? That's one example. So when you think that example, in the same time, NCsoft. I'm not, I'm not, by the way, I'm not picking on NCsoft. Just shut down City of Heroes as well shortly after, and you can see people were protesting. There was a big change that or campaign that says save our City of Heroes. For those of you who remember, it went viral on Facebook and on Twitter because they were really trying to stop it. And City of Heroes was maybe not billions of dollars but was still a tens of millions of dollars revenue project. So what happens when you shut that down? So one of the challenges is in the gaming industry today, we actually only play for fun and entertainment. We don't own anything, right? So it's a bit like when you go to a clothes store and you buy some clothes, and if the clothes company shuts down, your clothes disappear. That's exactly what happens in the game world. You don't get billions of dollars of revenue for people spending $1. People have.
Spent as you may know, especially in Korea, tens of thousands of dollars on their games. What happens to the psychology of a player when you spend tens of thousands of dollars and then it's all gone? Even though you play for entertainment and you realize that it's not supposed to be an investment, you still lost money. So for those of you who have maybe made an investment anywhere around the world, after you lose money, are you that interested in investing again? You'll be more careful, but what happens if that can be changed? And what happens if actually when I play a game, I don't actually really end up losing anything, even if the game itself goes? But could we change the way in which we look at our buying and spending behavior? So right now, games are something where we have lost our trust. Nobody expects a game to last forever, so if it doesn't last forever, why should I invest in it in a serious amount? Why should I convert more? This is where we think non-functional tokens in the space will save the day. So first, how do we get into this space? Well, I think who here has not heard of CryptoKitties? Ok great, so I don't have to go to too much detail since we are after all in a blockchain event. So broadly speaking, right, what CryptoKitties did is introduced the concept.
